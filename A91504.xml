            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are haply thoſe who would expect in this place a certain character of JESUI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISME.

But this is the main deſign of the whole Treatiſe, and what it does with ſuch life and conviction, as muſt needs work a ſtrange altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in mankind; that is, a body ſo powerfu l as as that of the JESUITS, and ſo ſcattered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over the face of the earth, will be looked on hereafter as the moſt abominable and moſt deſpicable thing in the world. Leaving therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcover what ever may be of horrour, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and extravagance in their MAXIMES, out of the LETTERS themſelves, all that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive neceſſary in this place, is, to give a ſhort account of the occaſion of writing, and the main heads of theſe LETTERS, as alſo of the
<pb facs="tcp:115411:4"/> ſtate of affaires at that time, and laſtly to ſay ſomething of the AUTHOR. To which is added, what effect they have had ſince; and this is thought but requiſite, out of a reflection on thoſe, who, in regard the ſcene lyes in another Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, being unacquainted with ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, would haply be glad of ſuch ſatisfact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſhall not need to unravell the whole diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Janſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>niſts</hi> and the <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> ſince that, as well thoſe that know it not, as thoſe that do, may be ſufficiently ſatisfied out of the LETTERS themſelves. All then I ſhall note is the ſtate of affaires at the Colledge of SOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BONNE when theſe Letters came firſt abroad. That was when the Colledge had ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſemblies about the examination of the ſecond Letter of M. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> about the beginning of the year M.DC.LVI. What the Colledge could not do, what all the writings that came abroad on both ſides could not ſatisfie the world of, theſe <hi>Letters</hi> did, clearing up the difficulties, and telling us, that there were two Queſtions examined; one relating onely to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>of fact,</hi> and conſequently eaſily reſolved, the other <hi>of faith,</hi> wherein all the difficulty lay.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 44.</note> The queſtion of <hi>Faith</hi> was, whether a Propoſition which M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of two Fathers of the Church, Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> ought to be approved or condemned. The Doctors of all ſides agreed that it was Catholick in the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but the Adverſaries of M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he had changed it in the citation, ſo far as to have made it hereticall. The buſineſſe then was to diſcover the difference, which his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb facs="tcp:115411:4"/> endeavoured to make appeare; but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders ſo confuted that pretended diverſity, that the <hi>Moliniſts</hi> were forced to deny them the liberty of Anſwering, by limiting their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to half an hour, which was meaſured out by a glaſſe. This breach of priviledge was it that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to forbear the Aſſembly, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what ever were done there to be null.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Arnauld's</hi> adverſaries being by this means left alone in <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> did what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without any oppoſition, and inſiſted parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly on three points concerning <hi>grace,</hi> which are explicated in theſe Letters.</p>
            <p>The firſt, concerning that which they call <hi>next Power,</hi> is explicated in the <hi>firſt</hi> Letter.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, concerning <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> is treated of in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Letter.</p>
            <p>The laſt, relating to that which they call <hi>actuall Grace,</hi> is cleared up in the <hi>fourth</hi> Letter.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>third</hi> Letter, written immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Cenſure,</hi> diſcovers the perfect conformity there is between the propoſition of M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> and that of the Fathers, which is ſuch, that the Doctors that cenſur'd it could not aſſign any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: So that theſe foure Letters cleare up all theſe points by certain conferences which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor pretends to have had with ſeverall Doctors.</p>
            <p>The ſixe following Letters, <hi>viz.</hi> the V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. and X. explicate the <hi>Morality</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> by certain diſcourſes between the <hi>Author</hi> and a <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> of theirs. The Author acts the part of a man deſirous to be inſtructed; and, hearing ſuch extravagant maximes, is ſtartled, yet not thinking it convenient to diſcover the horror he conceived thereat, entertaines them with all the
<pb facs="tcp:115411:5"/> moderation he could. That obliges the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to diſcover things more freely; not but that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten finds him at a loſſe, but attributing it to the novelty of the maximes, he goes on ſtill, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſaid by the beſt reaſons of the moſt eminent Authors of the Society.</p>
            <p>The Caſuiſt is one that would haply abhorre the lewdneſſe of thoſe principles, were it not for the implicite reſpect he hath for his Authors, whoſe opinions he thinks ſo ſacred that he ever quotes their own words, not fearing to publiſh any thing for which he hath their Security. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this confidence does he diſcover their <hi>Morality</hi> as contributing much to the ſaving of a many ſoules; not conſidering that what they allow as a prudent and Chriſtian expedient, is a baſe poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall compliance with the moſt irregular paſſions of men.</p>
            <p>Theſe conferences are continued till they come to certain eſſentiall points, whereat the Author is ſo incenſed that he cannot but exclaim againſt the inſupportable prophaneneſſe they muſt needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce. So that the Father, being come to the higheſt exceſſes, as for inſtance, that of clearing Chriſtian Morality of the obligation of Loving God, and affirming that it is enough if a man do not hate him, The Author breaks off, and ſo puts a period to that kind of entertainment with the X. Letter.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears of what concernment it was that this buſineſſe ſhould be treated of by way of Dialogue; ſince the Author does not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with the maximes of the Jeſuits, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <pb facs="tcp:115411:5"/>
            <p>The main deſign of their Morality we find to be this; <hi>viz.</hi> to draw all the world to themſelves by accommodation and compliance. To this end are their maximes levelled to the ſeverall humours of men. And becauſe theſe contrary inclinations oblige them to have contrary op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This corruption, which indeed is the ſouce of all the reſt, is explicated in the V. VI. and XIII.

And laſtly the X. which, as I have ſaid, ends with the diſpenſation from loving God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us with the mitigations of <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which are ſuch that the ſinnes they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, are ſo eaſily waſhed away by their new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, that, as they ſay themſelves, <hi>Crimes are now expiated with greater chearfulneſſe then they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> ſenſible of the prejudice theſe <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> did them, and finding that their ſilence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed it, thought themſelves obliged to make ſome anſwer thereto: but even in that they were infinitely at a loſſe.</p>
            <p>Two queſtions clear up the buſineſſe: one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> have taught theſe opinions, and that is a truth in matter of fact not to be diſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. The other, whether the opinions are not impious and unmaintainable; and that, their extravagances conſidered, is as much out of all controverſie as the other. So they took pains to no purpoſe, and ſo unſucceſſefully, that all their undertakings have proved abortive. For the firſt thing they writ they called <hi>A firſt Anſwer,</hi> but there never came forth any ſecond. They put out in like manner <hi>the firſt and ſecond Letter to Philar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115411:6"/> and never came to a third. Then they laid the foundations of a long work, which they ealled IMPOSTURES, whereof th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At laſt Father <hi>Annat,</hi> rallying all he could to come in to the ſuccour of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath ſent out his laſt book called <hi>The Faire Dealing of the Janſeniſts,</hi> a meer repetition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe the weakeſt of their productions; ſo that the Author of the Letters hath found it no hard matter to make his party good.</p>
            <p>The XI. Letter is ſpent to anſwer the reproch they faſten on him for the <hi>Raillery</hi> there may be in his Letters. For beſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that it is the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall way to anſwer what is <hi>ridiculous</hi> by <hi>deriſion,</hi> it is not diſconſonant to the practiſe of the Saints, and conſequently does Religion no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vlence, nor is guilty of any breach of charity.</p>
            <p>In the XII. XIII. and XIV. he comes to the reproches they make him of not faithfully citing the paſſages of their Authors. And this, as a point of great concernment, he is the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to cleare himſelf of. Nor indeed can any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man conceive he ſhould hazard his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with good men, ſo much as to urge a falſe citation, when it would have been ſo eaſie for his Adverſaries to evince the contrary againſt him. But beſides the many profeſſions he makes of his diligence, to avoid not onely the leaſt falſe citations, but even the leſt diſtortion of a ſentence of theirs, I have an acknowledgement of his by way of Poſt-ſcript to the XVI. Letter, which, to the confuſion of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are ſo free both to advance and maintain any, though ever ſo
<pb facs="tcp:115411:7"/> groundleſſe calumny, I muſt here inſert, as being omitted in its proper place. He in the XV. Letter, had ſuſpected a certain perſon to be the Author of their Apologies; it proving otherwiſe he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. <hi>I underſtand,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that he whom all the world thought Author of your</hi> Apologies, <hi>diſclaimes them, and is troubled that they are fathered on him. He does well, and I was too blame to think him guilty of any ſuch thing. For what aſſurance ſoever might have been given me of it, yet ſhould I have thought him a perſon of too much judgement to believe your Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and of too much honour to publiſh them if he did not. There are f w in the world that dare once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with thoſe exceſſes that are familiar with you, and which carry but too much of your character to afford me any excuſe, that I knew you not thereby. I was carryed away with the common report. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe which were haply too much for you is not enough for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall principle thereof in the XV. viz. <hi>That accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Divinity, they may, without crime, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate thoſe by whom they think themſelves unjuſtly medled with, and charge them w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115411:7"/>
            <p>This Maxime being ſo firme, it were certainly no great wonder they ſhould put it in practice upon the Author of the Letters, and all their Adverſaries. But ſince it is ſo eaſie for them to load any one with calumnies, according to this principle, it is as eaſie for the Author to waſh off thoſe vain reproches of impoſture and hereſie, by the aſſiſtance of truth. And this latter, though it fill up all their writings, yet does Father <hi>Annat</hi> very eagerly aggravate in his book of the <hi>Fair Dealing.</hi> This is anſwered in the XVII. Letter, where the Author cleares not onely himſelf but the Church from hereſie, and makes it appear that the difference between the Jeſuits and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaies about the five Propoſitions, condemned by <hi>Innocent</hi> X. amounts to no more then a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <hi>of fact,</hi> concerning the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> That is alſo in ſome part the ſubject of the XVIII. Letter, which he concludes with ſeverall inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Popes eluded and over-reached by the falſe informations of Religious Sycophants.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Letters,</hi> which, becauſe the firſt ten were written to a Provincial, are called <hi>Les Provinciales.</hi> Something would be ſaid of the <hi>Author,</hi> but there's no more known of him then what he hath been pleaſed to afford us of himſelf. He hath lately appeared under the name of <hi>Louis de Montalte.</hi> He hath often declared that he is neither <hi>Prieſt</hi> nor <hi>Doctor,</hi> which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> would interpret, as if he were no <hi>Divine;</hi> but how well he is acquainted with true Divinity, there needs no more then his own <hi>Letters</hi> to prove.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs, in a word, to give ſome little account of the effects of theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> that is, bring the Reader to the preſent poſture of
<pb facs="tcp:115411:8"/> affairs, in relation to them. The Letters were no ſooner abroad, but the Paſtors of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rouen</hi> would needs examine the citations, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently demand that either the <hi>Letters,</hi> or the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> cited therein, ſhould be cenſured, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they were either contrary or conformable thereto. The manner of proceeding by thoſe of <hi>Rouen,</hi> is thus deſcribed by one of them in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a friend of his. <hi>The Paſtors of</hi> Rouen, ſaith he, <hi>becauſe they would not haſtily, but with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, engage in this buſineſs, had a debate in one of their aſſemblies, about conſulting the books, whence it was ſaid that the propoſitions and pernicious Maximes preached againſt by the Paſtor of Saint</hi> Maclou, <hi>had been taken, and that true copies and extracts ſhould be made thereof. This done, that the condemnation thereof ſhould be required by canonical wayes, if they were found in the Caſuiſts, what quality or condition ſoever they were of. And if they ſhould not be found there, that the proſecution might determine as to them, and be directed to procure a cenſure of the</hi> LETTERS TO THE PROVINCIAL, <hi>wherein thoſe doctrines with the Authors thereof were cited. Six of the Company were named to manage that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they spent therein a whole moneth, doing all things with all poſsible fidelity and exactneſs: they ſought out the places cited; they found them, word for word, as they were cited, in he Originals. They drew copies thereof, and reported the whole to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in a ſecond aſſembly, wherein for further certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it was ordered; That any among them that were deſirous of further ſatisfaction as to thoſe matters, ſhould be at liberty to come to the perſons deputed, into the places where the books were, to conſult them and compare them as they pleaſed. This order was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb facs="tcp:115411:8"/> and for five or ſix dayes after, there were ten or eleven Paſtors at a time ſearching after the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and comparing them with the Authors, and were all ſatisfied. Could there be more circumſpection uſed in any buſineſs? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this ſearch the Paſtors unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of their Arch-Biſhop the condemnation of theſe errours, and thereupon writ to thoſe of <hi>Paris,</hi> who immediately joyned with them and with all thoſe of the Kingdome, to demand of their Prelates, that a cenſure might paſs as well againſt the Maximes cited in thoſe LETTERS, as againſt a great number of others which they had themſelves diſcovered and preſented to the <hi>Clergy</hi> of France.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From what hath been ſaid, may be, not impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtarted this queſtion, viz:</hi> What Idea men ſhould conceive of theſe excellent JESUITS and other CASUISTS? <hi>To which it may be juſtly anſwered, That, it being proved againſt them, that they not onely maintain theſe</hi> extravagant MAXIMES, <hi>but dayly brood ſuch as are yet more</hi> horrid <hi>and</hi> monſtrous, <hi>they ought to be looked on as the</hi> vermine <hi>of Religion and humane Society, and conſequently, accountable for all the inconveniences and miſchiefs occaſioned thereby.</hi>

                  </gap> it I ſhall in few words ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with, having my ſelf ſearch'd into the bottome of the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>There are two Queſtions examin'd, one <hi>of Fact,</hi> the other <hi>of Right.</hi> That of <hi>fact</hi> conſiſts in this, <hi>viz.</hi> whether Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> be temerarious, for having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his ſecond Letter, <hi>That he had very carefully read over</hi> Janſenius<hi>'s book, that nowithſtanding, he had not found therein the propoſitions condemn'd by the last Pope; and that nevertheleſs, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd thoſe propoſitions, whereſoever they were found, ſo ſhould he do it in</hi> Janſenius, <hi>if ſo be they were in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The queſtion is this, whether he could without temerity make ſuch an expreſſion of his being diſ-ſatisfied that the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> when the Biſhops
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115411:13"/> had before declar'd they were there?</p>
               <p>The buſineſs is propoſ'd in <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> Threeſcore and eleven <hi>Doctors</hi> undertake his vindication, and maintain that he could make no other anſwer to thoſe, who by ſo many writings, put him to the queſtion whether he held the propoſitions to be in that book, but that he had not ſeen them there, and nevertheleſs that if they be, he condemns them.</p>
               <p>There were ſome went a little further, declaring that notwithſtanding the ſtrict ſearch they had made after them, they could never find them there; nay, that they had met with ſuch as were quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and thereupon very earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, That if there were any Doctor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent who had found them there, he would be pleaſ'd to ſhew them; a thing ſo eaſie, that it could not well be deny'd, as being the moſt certain way to convince them all; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> himſelf. But this they could never obtain. And ſo much as to what concerns that party.</p>
               <p>Of the other, were fourſcore <hi>ſecular</hi> Doctors, and ſome half as many begging <hi>Friers,</hi> who have condemn'd the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> without ever exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether what he had affirm'd were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115411:14"/> true or falſe, and that after it had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that not the <hi>truth</hi> but the <hi>raſhneſs</hi> of his propoſition was under conſideration.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe were fifteen, who would not ſubſcribe the <hi>Cenſure,</hi> and are accordingly termed <hi>Indifferents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus was the Queſtion of <hi>Fact</hi> decided, whereat I am not troubled a jot, for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> be raſh or no, my conſcience is nothing concern'd. Or were I ſo deſirous to know whether theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> his book is neither ſo ſcarce, nor of that bulk, but that for my own ſatisfaction I might read him all over, and never conſult <hi>Sorbonne</hi> about it.</p>
               <p>But were I not afraid to be thought te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious my ſelf, I think I ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the opinion of the greateſt part of thoſe who having hitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it upon the publick faith, that theſe propoſitions are in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> begin now to miſtruſt the contrary from that fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick refuſal the others make to ſhew them, which indeed is ſuch, that I could never yet meet with any one who told me he had ſeen them there. Inſomuch that it is my fear, this cenſure may do more hurt then good, and give thoſe who ſhall come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115411:14"/> the knowledge of it an impreſſion thereof, quite contrary to the concluſion. The world is grown extremely miſtruſtful, and men believe not things till they ſee them. But as I have already ſaid, that point is of no great conſequence, ſince Faith is not at all concern'd in it.</p>
               <p>For the Queſtion <hi>of Right,</hi> it ſeems to be of greater concernment becauſe it does relate to <hi>Faith;</hi> for which reaſon I have the more particularly informed my ſelf thereof. But I ſhall give you ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, that you will find it a thing of as little importance as the former.</p>
               <p>In this it is examin'd what Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſayes in the ſame Letter, <hi>viz. That the Grace without which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing, had failed Saint</hi> Peter <hi>in his fall.</hi> Whence you and I conceiv'd that the buſineſs was to examine the main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Grace,</hi> as whether it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd on all men, or whether it be efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but we were much miſtaken. I am in a ſhort time grown a great Divine, and you ſhall acknowledge as much.</p>
               <p>To know the truth of the buſineſs, I viſited Monſieur <hi>N.</hi> a Doctor of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who lives not far from me, and is, as you know, one of the moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115411:15"/> zealous againſt the <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> But I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then as violent out of curioſity as he out of zeal, ask'd him whether it would not be formally decided, <hi>that Grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on all men,</hi> that ſo we may at length hear no more of that queſtion. He gave me a ſcornful retort, and told me, that that was not the point; that there were ſome of his party who held that grace was not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all; That the examiners themſelves had openly, before a full Aſſembly at <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> affirm'd the opinion to be <hi>problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall;</hi> and that he himſelf was of that opinion; confirming it by a paſſage which he ſaid was very remarkable in Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, viz. we know that grace is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſir'd him to excuſe my miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his meaning, and entreated him to tell me, whether they would not at leaſt condemn that other opinion of the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> which makes ſo much noiſe in the world, <hi>that grace is efficacious, and that it determines our will to do that which is good.</hi> But I was no leſs unfortunate in this ſecond queſtion. You underſtand nothing at all of the buſineſs, ſaid he to me, there's no hereſie in that, 'tis an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox opinion, all the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> maintain it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115411:15"/> and I held it my ſelf in my exerciſe at <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I durſt not preſume to trouble him with any further doubts, nay was at a loſs where the difficulty ſhould be; but to be a little better ſatisfied, I intreated him to ſhew me wherein conſiſted the hereſie of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s propoſition. In this, ſaid he, that he does not acknowledge that the juſt have a power to fulfil the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God in the manner that we underſtand it.</p>
               <p>Having learnt ſo much I took my leave of him, and very much elevated that I knew what was moſt conſiderable in the buſineſs; I went to Monſieur <hi>N.</hi> who grows ſtronger every day then other, and was then arriv'd to that degree of health that he brought me to his brother in law, a <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> if ever there were any, and yet a very honeſt man. To be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd, I pretended to be of his ſide, and ſaid to him, Could it be poſſible that the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> ſhould introduce into the Church ſuch an errour, as, <hi>That all the juſt have at all times a power to fulfill the Commandments?</hi> How do you ſpeak, ſayes the Doctor to me, do you call that an errour which is a <hi>Catholick</hi> Tenent, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115411:16"/> oppoſ'd by none but <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts?</hi> Why, ſaid I, are not you of that opinion? No, ſaid he, we anathematize it as heretical and impious. Awaken'd a little by this anſwer, I perceived that I had over-acted the <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> now, as I had done the <hi>Moliniſt</hi> before. But being not fully ſatisfied with his anſwer, I deſir'd him to tell me ſincerely whether he held, <hi>that the juſt had alwayes a reall power to obſerve the Commandments.</hi> This ſet him a little on fire, but it was with a devout zeal; whereupon he told me that he would never diſſemble his opinions for any man whatſoever, that it was his belief, and that he and all of his party would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to the death, as being the uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted doctrine of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> their Maſter.</p>
               <p>This he ſpoke with ſo much earneſtneſs, that I could not doubt his reality. With this confidence I return'd to my former Doctor, and fully ſatisfied, told him that no queſtion there would ſoon be a peace concluded in <hi>Sorbonne;</hi> that the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> were agreed as to the power which the juſt have to fulfil the Commandments. Soft and fair, ſaid he, a man muſt be a Divine ere he can ſee the end of the buſineſs.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115411:16"/> The difference which is between us is ſo ſubtile, that we can hardly diſcover it our ſelves; it's a thing you will not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily underſtand. It's enough for you to know that the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> will indeed tell you, that all the juſt have at all times a power to fulfil the Commandments, that's not the thing we diſpute about. But they will not tell you that this power is a <hi>next power.</hi> There's the point.</p>
               <p>This word was both new and harſh to me. Till then I had underſtood things well enough, but this terme caſt me into a cloud, and I think there was no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the invention of it, then that of making a confuſion. I thereupon deſir'd him to give me the explication of it, but he making me believe there was ſomething of myſtery in it, ſent me back again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other ſatisfaction, to ask the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> whether they would admit this <hi>next power.</hi> I burthen'd my memory with this terme, for my underſtanding contributed nothing thereto; and for fear of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, I went immediately to my <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> and as ſoon as our firſt complements were over, bluntly ask'd him; Tell me I pray, ſaid I, do you admit the <hi>next pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi> He began to laugh, and ſaid to me
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115411:17"/> ſomewhat faintly, do you tell pie in what ſenſe you underſtand it, and I will give you my thoughts of it. My knowledge in the buſineſs was not ſo great, but that I ſaw my ſelf in an incapacity to anſwer him, and yet to make advantage of my viſit, I told him at random, I underſtand it, ſaid I, according to the ſenſe of the <hi>Moliniſts.</hi> At which being not at all mov'd, to whom among the <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> ſaid he, do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me? I bid him take them altogether, as making all but one body, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by one and the ſame ſpirit.</p>
               <p>You are much to ſeek in the buſineſs, ſaid he, they are ſo far from maintaining the ſame opinions, that they hold ſuch as are meer contraries. But being all united in the deſign to deſtroy Monſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> they have bethought them to agree in ſomething, <hi>viz.</hi> the terme, <hi>next,</hi> which both the one and the other make uſe of, though they underſtand it ſeveral wayes, ſo to ſpeak the ſame language; as alſo that by this ſeeming conformity they might form a conſiderable body, and make up the greateſt number, ſo to be the more able to cruſh him.</p>
               <p>This anſwer I was ſtartled at, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking much impreſſion of the wicked
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115411:17"/> deſigns of the <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> which I ſhall not credit upon his word, and wherein I am not at all concern'd; I made it my endeavour only to know the ſeveral ſenſes which they gave that myſterious word, <hi>next.</hi> I ſhould be very glad to give you ſatisfaction, ſaid he, but you will find ſuch a manifeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repugnance and contradiction in it, that you would hardly believe me, nay you would diſtruſt me: Your ſurer way were to learn it from themſelves, I will give you directions how to do it. You are onely to viſit at ſeveral times Monſieur <hi>le Moine,</hi> and Father <hi>Nicolai.</hi> I know neither, ſaid I; then ſee, ſaid he, whether you know any of thoſe I ſhall now name to you; for they follow the ſentiments of Monſieur <hi>le Moine.</hi> It happen'd that I knew ſome of them. Then, ſaid he, ſee whether you know any of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> whom they call <hi>new Thomiſts,</hi> for they are all ſuch as Father <hi>Nicolai.</hi> I alſo knew ſome among thoſe he nam'd to me; whereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make the beſt advantage I could of this advice, and to get once out of the buſineſs, I took leave of him, and went firſt to one of the diſciples of Monſieur <hi>le Moine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I entreated him to tell me what was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115411:18"/> meant by <hi>having the next power to do a thing.</hi> That's no hard matter to reſolve, ſaid he, it is to have whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to do it, ſo that there be nothing wanting to act. According to which, ſaid I, to have the <hi>next power</hi> to croſs a river, is to have a boat, boat-men, oares, and the reſt, ſo that nothing be wanting. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right, ſaid he. And to have the next power to ſee, ſaid I, is to have a good ſight, and light enough. For he who hath ever ſo good a ſight in the dark, would not have the next power to ſee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your doctrine, ſince that light would be wanting, without which nothing can be ſeen. Very learnedly, ſaid he. And conſequently, added I, when you ſay that all the juſt have alwayes a <hi>next power</hi> to obſerve the Commandments, your meaning is that they have at all times all the graces neceſſary for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them, ſo that there wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on Gods behalf. Hold, ſaid he, they have at all times whatſoever is neceſſary for the obſervation of them, or at leaſt for their praying to God for it. I apprehend you, ſaid I, they have whatſoever is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to pray unto God to aſſiſt them, it being not neceſſary they ſhould have any new
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115411:18"/> grace from God ſo to pray. You are in the right, ſaid he. But is it not neceſſary, ſaid I, they ſhould have an <hi>efficacious grace</hi> to pray unto God? Not at all, ſaid he, according to Monſieur <hi>le Moine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To loſe no time, I went to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and ask'd for thoſe whom I knew to be of the <hi>new Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi> I intreated them to tell me what <hi>next power</hi> ſignified. Is it not that, ſaid I to them, wherein there is nothing wanting for to act? No ſaid they: how Father, ſaid I, will you call that power next, when there is ſomething wanting to it, and will you ſay, for example, that a man in the night, and without any light, hath the <hi>next power</hi> to ſee? we affirm that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our doctrine he ſhall have ſuch a power, if he be not blind. I am content, ſaid I, but Monſieur <hi>le Moine</hi> underſtands it in a contrary manner. 'Tis true, ſaid they, but we underſtand it thus. With all my heart, ſaid I, for I never quarrel about the <hi>terme,</hi> provided I have ſome account of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> wherein it is taken. But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hence, that when you ſay the juſt have alwayes the <hi>next power</hi> to pray unto God, your meaning is that they ſtand in need of another aſſiſtance to engage them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115411:19"/> to pray, without which they never will. You apprehend excellently well, reply'd the Fathers, embracing me, excellently well. For they muſt have further an <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> grace, which is not given to all, and which determines their will to pray. And it is a hereſie to deny the neceſſity of this efficacious grace in order to prayer.</p>
               <p>Excellently well, ſaid I to them, in my turn; but according to you, the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> are Catholicks, and Monſieur <hi>le Moine</hi> a Heretick. For the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> affirm that the juſt have the power to pray, but that there is nevertheleſs requiſite an <hi>efficacious</hi> grace, which tenet you approve. And Monſieur <hi>le Moine</hi> ſaith, that the juſt pray without <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fficacious</hi> grace, &amp; that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. Very right ſaid they, yet Monſieur <hi>le Moine</hi> calls this power, a <hi>next power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How Fathers, ſaid I, this is no more then to play upon words, to ſay, that you are agreed, becauſe of the common termes you make uſe of, when you are contrary in the ſenſe. The Fathers made no reply at all, when juſt upon the word comes in my diſciple of Monſieur <hi>le Moine</hi> I had been with before, which I thought an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good fortune; but I have heard ſince that their meetings are not ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115411:19"/> ſeldome, and that there is almoſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant converſation between them.</p>
               <p>I know a man, ſaid I, to my diſciple of Monſieur <hi>le Moine,</hi> who ſayes that all the juſt have alwayes the power to pray unto God; but yet that they will never pray without an efficacious grace determining them, which God gives not to all the juſt at all times; is he an <hi>Heretick</hi> or no? Stay, ſayes the Doctor, you may ſurpriſe me. Soft and fair, <hi>Diſtinguo,</hi> if he call this power a <hi>next power,</hi> he ſhall be a <hi>Thomiſt,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>Catholik;</hi> if not, he ſhall be a <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> and conſequently an <hi>Heretick.</hi> He, ſaid I, neither calls it <hi>next,</hi> nor <hi>not next.</hi> He is then an <hi>Heretick,</hi> ſaid he, ask theſe good Fathers elſe. They ſhall be no Judges in this caſe, for they were already giving their conſent by a nod with the head. But I told them, this man denies to admit the word <hi>next,</hi> becauſe the authors thereof will not explain it. Upon that one of the Fathers would needs give it a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, but he was interrupted by the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Monſieur <hi>le Moine,</hi> who ſaid to him, Muſt you needs renew our diſtractions? Are we not agreed not to explain that word <hi>next,</hi> and to make uſe of it on all ſides, without ſaying what it ſignifies?

               <p>By this did I diſcover their deſign, and riſing up to be gone, told them; In troth, Fathers, I am very much afraid that there is abundance of foul practice among you, and be what will the reſult of your Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, I dare foretell that though the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were given, peace would not be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. For take the word as you pleaſe, if there be no explication of it, either ſide may pretend to the victory. The <hi>Dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> will ſay that the word is taken in their ſenſe; Monſieur <hi>le Moine</hi> will have it in his, and ſo it will coſt much more diſputes to explain it, then it hath to introduce it. For, when all is done, there were no great danger to receive it without any ſenſe, ſince it can do no hurt but by the ſenſe. But it is a thing does not become <hi>Sorbonne</hi> and <hi>Theologie,</hi> to uſe equivocal and cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling termes without any explication. And therefore in a word, Fathers, tell me once for all, what I ought to believe to be a Catholick; you muſt, ſaid they altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, affirm that the juſt have the <hi>next power,</hi> taking it abſtractedly as to all ſenſe; <hi>abſtrahendo à ſenſu Thomiſtarum, &amp; à ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu aliorum Theologorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to ſay, ſaid I, taking my leave,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115411:21"/> a man muſt pronounce that word with his lips, to avoid being an heretick in name. For in fine, have you the word out of the <hi>Scripture?</hi> No, ſaid they. Have you it from <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> or <hi>Popes?</hi> No. Is it Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s? No. What neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is there then, ſaid I, to meddle with it, ſince it hath neither authority nor any ſenſe of it ſelf? You are very obſtinate, ſaid they, you ſhall either affirme it or be an heretick, and Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> alſo; for we are the ſtronger party; and if there be occaſion, we can bring in ſo many <hi>Franciſcans</hi> that we ſhall clearly carry it.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſolid reaſon I left them for to write you this relation, whereby you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they meddle not with any of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing points, and that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by either ſide.</p>

               <p>AS I was cloſing up the laſt I ſent you, there came to give me a viſit Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>N</hi> our ancient friend, the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in the world for my curioſity; for he is extreme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y well verſ'd in the Queſtions of the times, and is perfectly well read in the ſecrets of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> among whom he not onely continually is, but hath the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the moſt eminent. After a little diſcourſe of the occaſion that had brought him to me; I entreated him to tell me in a word what were the main points in controverſie between the two parties.</p>
               <p>He preſently inform'd me, and ſaid, there were two principal points; the firſt concerning the <hi>next power;</hi> the ſecond touching <hi>ſufficient grace.</hi> Of the former you have an account in my laſt; in this you ſhall have of the latter.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115411:23"/>
               <p>I underſtood then briefly that their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> is this: That the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> pretend there is a grace generally given to all, yet ſo far compliant with the <hi>Free-will,</hi> that this latter makes the other <hi>efficacious</hi> or <hi>inefficacious</hi> at its choice, without any new ſupply from God, on whoſe behalf there is not any thing wanting for to act effectually. For this reaſon they call it <hi>ſufficient,</hi> becauſe it alone ſufficeth for to act. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>Janſenists</hi> will not admit there ſhould be any grace actually <hi>ſufficient</hi> which is not alſo <hi>efficacious,</hi> that is to ſay, that all thoſe graces which do not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the will to act effectively are inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to act, becauſe, as they ſay, a man never acts without <hi>efficacious grace.</hi> This is the difference between them.</p>
               <p>Enquiring afterwards of the doctrine of the new <hi>Thomiſts.</hi> 'Tis fantaſtick, ſayes he, they agree with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> given to all men; but withal hold, that men never act with that only grace; and that for to oblige them to act, it is requiſite that God give them an <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious grace,</hi> really determining their will to the action, which grace God gives not to all. So that according to this doctrine, ſaid I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115411:23"/> to him, this grace is <hi>ſufficient,</hi> and yet is not ſuch. Very right, ſaid he, for if it ſuffice, there were no need of any more for to act; and if it ſufficeth not, it is not <hi>ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſaid I, what difference then is there between them and the <hi>Janſeniſts?</hi> This, ſaid he, that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> are at leaſt ſo far in the right, that they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm all men have <hi>ſufficient grace.</hi> I apprehend you, ſaid I, but they ſay it before they are aware, ſince they add, that for to act, it is abſolutely neceſſary to have an <hi>efficacious grace,</hi> ſuch as is not given to all, and ſo they comply with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> by a terme which hath no ſenſe, and are contrary to them, and agree with the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> in the ſubſtance of the thing. 'Tis very true, ſaid he. How then comes there an union, ſaid I, between them and the <hi>Jeſuits?</hi> and why do not theſe latter oppoſe them as well as they do the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> ſince they will meet with among them ſuch powerful adverſaries, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the neceſſity of <hi>efficacious grace</hi> which determines, will hinder them from eſtabliſhing that which you ſay is alone <hi>ſufficient?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That were too great an undertaking, ſaid he, it is more advantagious for them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115411:24"/> to comply with thoſe that are powerful in the Church. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they have prevail'd with them to admit the very terme of <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> though they underſtand it as they pleaſe; for they make this advantage of it, that when they pleaſe, they make the contrary opinion ridiculous and unmaintainable. For it being once ſuppoſ'd that all men have ſufficient grace; the concluſion is obvious, that efficacious grace is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſince that ſuch a neceſſity would exclude the ſufficiency before ſuppoſed. Nor would it ſignifie any thing to ſay that it is otherwiſe underſtood; the common acception of this terme admits not any ſuch explication: for he that ſayes, <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> ſayes all that is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> 'tis the proper and natural ſignification of it. Now were you but acquainted with what hath paſſ'd formerly, you would find that the Jeſuits have been ſo far from having their doctrine eſtabliſh'd, that you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire to ſee it advanc'd ſo much. Knew you but what rubs the <hi>Dominicans</hi> laid in their way under <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. and <hi>Paulus</hi> V. you would not wonder ſo much that they are ſo loth to enter the liſts againſt them, and that they are content they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115411:24"/> in their opinion, conditionally that they may as freely hold theirs, and that eſpecially when the Dominicans counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it by thoſe words which they have publickly agreed to make uſe of. They ſit down very contentedly with their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they do not preſs them to deny the neceſſity of <hi>efficacious grace,</hi> that were to be importunate; 'tis not good tyrannizing over ones friends; the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are very well aforehand. The world is ſatisfied with words, few ſearch into the depth of things, and ſo the terme of <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> being current on both ſides, though in a different ſenſe, ther's not any, except the moſt acute Divines, but think that what that word ſignifies is as well held by the <hi>Dominicans</hi> as the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> And the ſequel will diſcover that the latter are not the more eaſily over-reach'd.</p>
               <p>I acknowledg'd they were indeed very excellent men; and to make the beſt I could of his advice, I went ſtraight to the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> where I found at the gate a friend, and a great <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> (for I have ſome in all parties) asking for another Father then him I came to ſpeak with. But with much intreaty I prevailed with him to bear me company, and ſo ask'd for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115411:25"/> one of my <hi>new Thomists.</hi> Being come, he was extremely glad to ſee me. Well Father, ſaid I, it is not then enough that all men have a <hi>next power,</hi> whereby they never act to any effect, but they muſt alſo have a <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> wherewith they act as little. Is not this the opinion of your School? It is ſo, ſayes the Father; I have maintain'd it this very morning in <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne.</hi> I talk'd out my <hi>halfe hour</hi> there, and had it not been for the <hi>Sand,</hi> I would have alter'd that unhappy proverb which it already ſo rife in <hi>Paris; He votes as ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Frier in Sorbonne.</hi> And what do you mean, reply'd I, by your <hi>half hour</hi> and your <hi>ſand?</hi> Are your debates cut out by a certain meaſure? They are ſo, ſaid he, within theſe few dayes. And are you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſpeak for <hi>half an hour?</hi> No: a man may ſpeak as little as he pleaſes; but not as much, ſaid I? O the excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of ignorance! the rare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for thoſe who cannot ſay any thing worth the hearing! But in a word Father, is this grace which is given to all men <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> or no? It is, ſaid he. And yet it hath no effect without <hi>efficacious</hi> grace? Very right, ſaid he. And all men have this <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> continu'd I, and all have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115411:25"/> not the <hi>efficaciouſneſs?</hi> Very true, ſaid he. You mean, ſaid I, that all have graces e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and that all have not enough; that is to ſay, that this grace ſufficeth although it doth not ſuffice; that is to ſay, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in name, and inſufficient in effect. In troth, Father, this doctrine is very ſubtile. Have you forgot, becauſe you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the world, what the word <hi>ſufficient</hi> ſignifies among thoſe that have not? Do you not remember that it comprehends whatever is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for to act? But it is impoſſible your memory ſhould be ſo weak; for, to take a compariſon which you muſt be the more ſenſible of, if you had to dinner but two ounces of bread and a ſingle glaſs of water, would you be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with your Prior, who ſhould tell you that were ſufficient to nouriſh you, under pretence, that with ſomething elſe which he ſhould not give you, you would have whatever were neceſſary for you to dine well? How then are you ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeen as to affirme, that all men have ſufficient grace to act, when you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is yet ſome other grace ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to act, which all have not? Is it that this belief is of no great conſequence, and that you leave men at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115411:26"/> liberty to believe that efficacious grace is neceſſary, or not? Is it a thing indifferent to affirm, that a man having ſufficient grace, doth not act to any effect? How, ſayes the good Frier, indifferent! 'Tis a <hi>hereſie,</hi> 'tis a <hi>formal hereſie;</hi> the neceſſity of <hi>efficacious grace</hi> to act effectively is of <hi>Faith.</hi> It is <hi>hereſie</hi> to deny it.</p>
               <p>Where are we then, cry'd I, what ſide muſt I now take? If I deny <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> I am a <hi>Janſeniſt;</hi> if with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> I ſo admit it, that <hi>efficacious grace</hi> is not alſo neceſſary, I ſhall be an <hi>heretick,</hi> as you ſay. And if I admit it as you do, yet grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall a neceſſity of efficacious grace, I offend againſt common ſenſe, and am a mad-man, as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> affirme. What then muſt I do in this inevitable neceſſity of being either a <hi>mad-man,</hi> an <hi>heretick,</hi> or a <hi>Janſeniſt?</hi> And into what extremities are we reduc'd, if of all theſe, onely the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> offer no violence either to Faith or Reaſon, and are withall clear'd from errour and madneſs?</p>
               <p>My friend the <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> deriv'd a good omen from this diſcourſe, and thought me already convinc'd. However at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he ſaid nothing to me, but addreſſing himſelf to the Father, I would faine know,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115411:26"/> ſaid he, wherein you and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> agree. In this, ſaid he, that both the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and we do acknowledge <hi>ſufficient</hi> graces given to all. But, ſaid the other, there are two things in the word <hi>ſufficient grace;</hi> there is the ſound, which is onely winde; and the thing it ſignifies, which is real and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. So that when you agree with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> about the <hi>word</hi> [ſufficient] and are contrary to them as to the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> it is evident that you are contrary one to another as to the ſubſtance of that terme, and agree onely about the ſound. Is this a ſincere &amp; cordial proceeding? But what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have you to be troubled at it, ſayes the good man, ſince we betray no man by this manner of ſpeaking? For in our Schools we openly teach, that we underſtand it in a ſenſe contrary to that of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> I am troubled, ſaid my friend, that you do not declare it every where, that by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace you underſtand that grace which is not ſufficient. You are oblig'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when you thus change the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry termes of Religion, to acknowledge that when you admit a ſufficient grace in all men, your meaning is, that they have not ſufficient graces in effect. All perſons whatſoever take the word <hi>ſufficient</hi> in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115411:27"/> ſame ſenſe, onely the <hi>new Thomiſts</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it in another. All women, who make make up the beſt half of the world, all relating to Courts, all belonging to the wars; all Magiſtrates, all Lawyers, Merchants, Tradeſmen, all people; in a word, all ſorts of perſons, except the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi> underſtand by the word <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> that which comprehends what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is neceſſary. No man hath yet taken notice of this ſingularity; it is onely ſaid every where that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> hold, that all men have graces ſufficient. From whence what may be concluded, but that they hold all men have all the graces which are neceſſary to act, and that much more when they ſee them engag'd in the ſame intereſts &amp; deſigns with the Jeſuits who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it after that manner. The unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of expreſſions added to that union of parties, muſt certainly be an evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the uniformity of your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</p>
               <p>All the faithful ask the Divines what is the true ſtate of nature ſince its corruption. St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and his Diſciples anſwer, that it hath no more ſufficient grace then God is pleaſed to beſtow on it. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> come afterward, and ſay, that all have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115411:27"/> graces effectually ſufficient. The <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> are conſulted upon this contrariety; what do they? they cloſe with the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> by that union they make up the greateſt number. They ſeparate from thoſe who deny theſe graces to be ſufficient. They declare that all men are furniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. What can be ſaid of this leſs then that they countenance the <hi>Jeſuits?</hi> And yet after all this, they add, that however theſe ſufficient graces are fruitleſs without the efficacious, which are not given to all.</p>
               <p>Would you have a repreſentation of the Church amidſt theſe different opinions? I look on her as a man who leaving his Countrey to go and travell, is ſet upon by robbers, from whom he receives ſeveral wounds and is left half-dead. He ſends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next townes for <hi>three</hi> Phyſicians: The firſt having ſearch'd his wounds thinks them mortal, and plainly tells him that none but God can reſtore him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength. The ſecond coming after him, flatters the diſtreſſed man, and tells him that he had yet ſtrength <hi>ſufficient</hi> to recover his own houſe; and crow'd over the former, as being of an opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him, and laid a plot to deſtroy him. The poor man in this doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115411:28"/> ſpying the third coming afar off, reaches out his hands to him, as ſuch as he expected ſhould determine the buſineſs. This having look'd on his wounds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the judgments of the two former, embraces that of the ſecond, is united with him, and both together conſpire againſt the firſt, and ſhamefully force him away, for they are too ſtrong by reaſon of their number. The wounded man concludes by this proceeding of his, that he is of the ſame opinion with the ſecond, and asking him whether it were really ſo, he declares affirmatively that his ſtrength is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to go through his journey. But the other ſenſible of his own weakneſs, ask'd him whence he judg'd him to be ſo ſtrong? From this, ſaid he, that you ſtill have your legs. Now the legs are orga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s naturally ſufficient to go upon. But, ſays the ſick-man, have I all the ſtrength requiſite to make uſe of them? for in the languiſhing condition I now am in, methinks they are uſeleſs: No certainly, you have not, ſaies the Doctor, and you will never go effectively if God ſend you not his aſſiſtance from heaven to aſſiſt and guide you. How, ſayes the ſick, it ſeems I have not in my ſelf that <hi>ſufficient</hi> ſtrength, ſuch as to which there is nothing wanting,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115411:28"/> to walke effectively? Alas you are very far from it, ſaid he. Why then, ſayes the wounded man, you are of an opinion contrary to that of your companion, as touching the truth of my condition: I muſt needs acknowledge it, reply'd the other.</p>
               <p>What do you imagine this poor man ſaid? He was troubled at the fantaſtick carriage of this third Doctor. He blam'd him for joyning with the ſecond, to whom he was of a contrary opinion, and with whom he was but ſeemingly compliant; and diſcarding the firſt to whom he was conformable in effect. Whereupon trying his ſtrength, and finding by experience the truth of his weakneſs, he diſmiſſed them both, and calling for the firſt, put himſelf into his hands, and according to his advice, begg'd of God that ſtrength which he confeſſed he had not himſelf; he found mercy at his hands, and by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance came ſafely to his own houſe.</p>
               <p>The good Father a little aſtoniſh'd at ſuch a <hi>parable</hi> made no anſwer at all. Whereupon to revive him a little; But after all, Father, ſaid I, calmly to him, upon what account did you give the name <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to a grace which you ſay it is a point of faith to believe inſufficient in effect? You
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115411:29"/> ſpeak of it, ſaid he, as your humour leads you. You are free, and a private perſon; I am a religious man, and live in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; know you not what a difference this makes? we depend on our ſuperiours; they depend on others; thoſe have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſ'd our ſuffrages; what can I do? That half word was enough; we needed no more to put us in mind of his Brother-Frier who upon ſome ſuch occaſion was pack'd away like an exile to <hi>Abbeville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſaid I to him, how came your <hi>Order</hi> to be engag'd to admit this grace? That's another diſcourſe, ſaid he. All that I can in a word tell you of it, is, that our <hi>Order</hi> hath to its utmoſt maintain'd the doctrine of St <hi>Thomas</hi> concerning <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace.</hi> How violently did it oppoſe the firſt eruption of the doctrine of <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na?</hi> what pains hath it taken to eſtabliſh the neceſſity of the efficacious grace of Jeſus Chriſt? know you not what paſſ'd under <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. and <hi>Paul</hi> V. and that the one prevented by death, and ſome affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> hindring the other to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his <hi>Bull,</hi> our armes remain in the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican?</hi> But the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who upon the firſt breaking forth of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their advantage of the ſmall light
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115411:29"/> which the people have to diſcern errour from the truth of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, had in a ſmall time ſo generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſ'd their doctrine, that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolute Maſters of the popular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and we in a condition to be cry'd down as <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and treated as the <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts</hi> are at the preſent, if we did not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the truth of <hi>efficacious</hi> grace, by a ſeeming acknowledgment of a <hi>ſufficient.</hi> Being in this extremity, what better courſe could we take to ſecure <hi>Truth</hi> and our own <hi>reputation,</hi> then to admit the terme of <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace,</hi> yet denying it to be ſuch in effect? This is the true ſtate of affairs.</p>
               <p>This he ſpoke with ſo much regret that I much pittied him. But my ſecond not mov'd at it, Flatter not your ſelf, ſaid he to him, with ſo much tenderneſs to Truth; if ſhe had not met with other preſervers, ſhe had periſhed in ſuch weak hands. You have receiv'd into the Church the name of her enemy; 'tis no leſs then to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him in himſelf. Names are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from things; if the word <hi>ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nt grace</hi> be once eſtabliſh'd, it will be to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe for you to ſay, that you there by underſtand a grace that is inſufficient, you will not be heard. Your explication will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115411:30"/> be odious over all the world, where men ſpeak with much more ſincerity of things of leſs conſequence; the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> will tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; it will be <hi>their</hi> ſufficient grace in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and not <hi>yours,</hi> which is nothing but a name, that ſhall be eſtabliſh'd; and what is contrary to your belief, will become an article of faith.</p>
               <p>We will all ſuffer martyrdome, ſayes the Father, ere we conſent to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> according to the ſenſe of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> whom we are ſworn to follow, being directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite thereto. To which my friend being more eager then I, replyed; Come, come, Father, your <hi>Order</hi> hath receiv'd an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which it hath not manag'd well. It deſerts that grace which was committed to its truſt, and which was never forſaken ſince the beginning of the world. That victorious grace, which had been expected by the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> foretold by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> brought into the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> preached by St <hi>Paul,</hi> explain'd by St <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> the moſt eminent of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> maintain'd by thoſe who have followed him, and confirm'd by Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> the laſt of the Fathers; ſupported by Saint <hi>Thomas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Angel of the Schools; tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115411:30"/> by him to your <hi>Order;</hi> kept up by ſo many of your Fathers, and ſo gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended by thoſe of your Order under the Popes <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> this effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace, I ſay, which as a <hi>depoſitum</hi> hath been put into your hands, to the end that in an holy Order which was to laſt for ever, it might have preachers to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it to the end of the world, it is now forſaken for ſuch poor and unworthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. It is now time that other hands be arm'd in its quarrel. It is time that God raiſe up to the Doctor of Grace, ſuch bold diſciples, as unacquainted with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of the world, may ſerve God for his own ſake. Grace is no longer ſafe under the banners of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> but it ſhall never want defenders, for it forms them its ſelf by its own Almighty power. It requires hearts that are pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and purifies, and diſengages them from the intereſts of the world, as ſuch as are incompatible with the truths of the Goſpel. Prevent theſe threats, Father, and take heed that God remove not this torch out of its place, and leave you in in darkneſs, and without a crown.</p>
               <p>He had ſaid more, for he grew more and more inflam'd, but I interrupted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115411:31"/> him, and riſing up, In troth Father, ſaid I, were I a perſon in authority, I would have it cry'd with ſound of Trumpet, KNOW ALL MEN, <hi>that when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans ſay that ſufficient Grace is given to all, their meaning is, that all have not the grace which ſufficeth effectively;</hi> which done, you ſhould affirm it as much as you pleaſe; but not otherwiſe. And this cloſ'd our viſit.</p>
               <p>You ſee that this is a <hi>political ſufficiency</hi> ſuitable to the <hi>next power.</hi> But I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to tell you, that if a man be not a Dominican, he may without any danger queſtion not onely the <hi>next power,</hi> but alſo this <hi>ſufficient grace.</hi>

               <head>The Provincial's <hi>ANSWER</hi> to the two precedent <hi>LETTERS.</hi>
               </head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOur two Letters have not found me onely entertainment; they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeen, generally heard, generally believ'd. They are not onely eſteem'd by Divines; they are well receiv'd by thoſe of a lower ſphere in the world, nay they are underſtood even of Women.</p>
               <p>I here ſend you the thoughts of them, of a Gentleman of the <hi>Academy,</hi> one of the moſt eminent among thoſe moſt illuſtrious perſons, who had onely ſeen the firſt. <hi>I wiſh that</hi> Sorbonne, <hi>which owes ſo great an obligation to the memory of the late Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, would ſubmit to the juriſdiction of his French</hi> Academy; <hi>The author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould not be unſatisfied. For as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, I ſhould exerciſe my authority to condemn, to baniſh, to proſcribe, nay I ſhould not ſtick to ſay, to exterminate with all my power this ſame</hi> next power, <hi>which makes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115411:32"/> ſo much noiſe to no purpoſe, and that without knowing otherwiſe what he deſires. But the misfortune is, that our Academick power is limited, and cannot take cognizance of this caſe. I am ſorry for it, and that ſo much the more, that all the little power I have is not able to acquit me as to what I ow you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add to that, what another perſon, of whom I ſhall not give you the leaſt hint as to know him, hath written to a Lady who had ſent him your firſt Letter. <hi>I am oblig'd to you, much beyond what you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, for the Letter you ſent me; 'tis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ingenious, and excellently well penn'd. It diſcovers things without being too open; it clears up the cloudieſt things in the world; it ſatyriſes hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omely; it instructs even thoſe who are not at all acquainted with the things, but extremely heightens their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments who know them. It is, beſides all this, an excellent apology, and if you will, a ſubtile and ingenious cenſure. In a word, it diſcovers ſo much art, ſo much wit, and ſo much judgment, that I ſhould very gladly be acquainted with the Author,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but you would be as glad to know the perſon that gives it this chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; but you muſt be content to honour him without knowing him, and when you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115411:32"/> ſhall know him, you will honour him much more.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſ'd therefore to continue your Letters upon my account; and let the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> come when it will, we are provided to entertain it. Thoſe words of <hi>next power</hi> and <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> though threatned with, we are nothing afraid of. We are better taught by the <hi>Jeſuits, Dominicans,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>le Moine,</hi> as well concerning the many poſtures they are put into, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſolidity of theſe new words, then to trouble our heads about them.</p>

               <p>I Had no ſooner received your Letter, but there was brought me a written co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the <hi>Cenſure.</hi> I am as nobly treated in the one as Monſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I fear me there may be exceſs on both ſides, and that we are not well known by our Judges, for if we were, I am confident that Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> would deſerve the approbation of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> and I the cenſure of the <hi>Academy.</hi> There is indeed a contrariety in our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; he ſhould make himſelf known that he might vindicate his innocence, whereas I ſhould continue in obſcurity, that ſo I might not loſe my reputation. So that ſince I may not diſcover my ſelf, I recommend it to your care, to make my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to my noble <hi>Approbators,</hi> and it ſhall be mine to give you an account of the <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115411:33"/>
               <p>Sir, I muſt needs confeſs, I was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſ'd at it. I expected to find the moſt abominable hereſies in the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in it; but you will ſecond my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration with your own, to ſee that ſo many extraordinary preparations ſhould come to nothing juſt at the production of ſo great an effect.</p>
               <p>To underſtand it with more diverſion, I ſhall deſire you to reflect on the ſtrange impreſſions have been given us for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years of the <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> Then call to mind the Cabals, the factions, the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions, the ſchiſmes, the plots which have been for ſo long time laid to their charge. Add to that how much they have been traduc'd and defam'd in books and pulpits, and how that this torrent, which hath been ſo violent and of ſo long continuance, hath nevertheleſs increaſ'd within theſe late times, wherein they are openly and publickly accuſ'd, not onely as hereticks and ſchiſmaticks, but have been cenſur'd as Apoſtates and Infidels, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the myſterie of Tranſubſtantiation, and renouncing Jeſus Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>From ſo many ſuch horrid accuſations might well be hatch'd the deſign of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115411:34"/> their books, ſo to conclude them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch. Among the reſt they have fallen particularly on the ſecond Letter of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> which was given out to be fraught with the moſt deteſtable errours could be imagined. They appoint for his Examiners his moſt profeſſed enemies. Their main buſineſs is to ſift out whatever they ſhould think cenſurable; and they make report of a propoſition concerning the doctrine thereof, which they expoſe to <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What could be leſs expected from all theſe proceedings, then that that propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cull'd out from all the reſt with ſuch remarkable circumſtances, ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the eſſence of the blackeſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies imaginable? And yet it is ſuch, that there cannot be any thing ſeen therein which is not ſo clearly and ſo formally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd in thoſe paſſages of the Fathers, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> in that place, that I never yet meet with any man that could apprehend any the leaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. All which notwithſtanding it was imagin'd there was ſome terrible one, ſince that, the paſſages out of the Fathers being abſolutely Catholick, it muſt needs follow, that the propoſition of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115411:34"/> to be heretical, ſhould imply an inevitable contradiction thereto.</p>
               <p>It was from <hi>Sorbonne</hi> that this diſcovery was not without reaſon expected. The eyes of all Chriſtendome were open to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the cenſure of theſe Doctors that point which was ſo imperceptible to the community of man-kind beſides. In the mean time, Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> makes his Apologies, wherein, in ſeveral columns he laies down his own propoſition, and the paſſages out of the Fathers, whence he had taken it, ſo the better to diſcover the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, even to ordinary capacities.</p>
               <p>There we find Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in one place where he cites him, ſaying, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt ſhews us a juſt man in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>who by his fall teaches us to ſhun preſumption.</hi> He brings another out of the ſame Father, ſaying, <hi>That God, to ſhew us that we can do nothing without grace, hath left Saint</hi> Peter <hi>without grace.</hi> He cites another out of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That the fall of Saint</hi> Peter <hi>happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not out of any coldneſs in him towards Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; but becauſe grace failed him, and that it happened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Upon this do ſome endeavour, though ineffectually, to diſcover how it can come to paſs, that the expreſſion of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> is as different from thoſe of the Fathers, as Truth is from Errour, and Faith from Hereſie. For wherein conſiſts the difference? Is it that he ſayes, <hi>That the Fathers ſhew us a juſt man in the perſon of Saint</hi> Peter? They are the very words of Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Is it that he ſayes, <hi>that grace failed him?</hi> The ſame Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> who affirmed <hi>Saint</hi> Peter <hi>to be a juſt man,</hi> ſayes alſo, <hi>that upon that particular occaſion grace failed him.</hi> Is it that he ſayes, <hi>that without grace a man can do nothing?</hi> But is it any more then what Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſayes in the ſame place; nay, even what Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid before him, with this onely difference, that he expreſſes it more fully, where he ſayes, <hi>That his fall happened not through his coldneſs or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but through a defect of grace, and the dereliction of God.</hi>

               <p>All theſe conſiderations held the world in ſuſpence, as deſirous to know wherein this diverſity conſiſted, when at laſt this ſo famous and ſo long expected cenſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears after ſo many Aſſemblies. But alas! how ſtrangely hath it eluded our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation! For whether theſe good <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> thought it below them to give us any information of it, or for ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon known onely to themſelves, they have done no more then barely pronounc'd theſe words; <hi>This propoſition is temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, impious, blasphemous, worthy to be ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiz'd, and heretical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, could you believe it, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of people ſeeing themſelves eluded as to their hope, begin to grow quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and would be reveng'd on the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors themſelves? They draw from their carriage ſtrange conſequences for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld.</hi> What, ſay they, is this all ſo many Doctors ſo cruelly bent againſt one, could do in ſo long time, onely to find in all his works but three lines they can object any thing againſt, which yet are taken out of the very words of the moſt eminent Doctors of the Greek and Latine Churches? Is there any Author that they had a mind to ruine, whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115411:36"/> might not afford a more ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? What greater argument can we expect of the true Faith of this illuſtrious though cenſur'd perſon?</p>
               <p>Whence comes it, ſay they, that that they are ſo liberal of imprecations in the cenſure, where they faggot together all the moſt terrible expreſſions of <hi>poiſon, peſtilence, horrour, temerity, impiety, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, abomination, execration, Anathema, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> which are the moſt horrid could be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> nay <hi>Antichrist</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to confute an imperceptible hereſie, and that without making any diſcovery thereof? If this proceeding be againſt the words of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> where is <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Tradition?</hi> If againſt Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi>'s propoſition; let them ſhew us wherein it differs from the other, ſince we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing but a perfect conformity. When we ſhall be made ſenſible of the evil it may contain, we ſhall abhor it; but while we ſee no ſuch thing, and onely find the ſentiments of the holy Fathers comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and expreſſ'd in their proper termes, how can we avoid having an holy venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it?</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how ſome are incenſ'd, but they are ſuch as are too ſharp-ſighted.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115411:36"/> For us who dive not very deeply into things, our beſt courſe is to be quiet and to comply. Would we be more learned then our Maſters? Let us not undertake what they avoid, we ſhould loſe our ſelves in this diſquiſition. If we ſhould be too ſtrict, it's to be fear'd the Cenſure it ſelf would prove heretical. Truth is a thing ſo delicate, that when a man is at ever ſo little diſtance from it; he falls into errour, but this latter is alſo of ſuch a fine thread, that even before a man gets looſe from it, he jumps into the truth. There is but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible point between this propoſition and Faith. The diſtance is ſo inſenſible, that not perceiving it, I was afraid I ſhould be oppoſite to the Fathers of the <hi>Church,</hi> by agreeing too well with the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fear made me addreſs my ſelf to one of thoſe who were neuter in the firſt queſtion, to inform my ſelf truly of the buſineſs. I went to one I thought the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, whom I intreated to ſet down the circumſtances of this difference, ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſing I could not perceive any. To which he reply'd laughing; How ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are you to imagine there is any! where ſhould it be? Do you think if any ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115411:37"/> were, that the world ſhould not have hear of it, and that they would not have bee glad to expoſe it to the ſight of all thoſe in whoſe eſteem they would diſcredit Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnauld?</hi> By theſe few words I was ſatisfied that all thoſe who were neuters in the firſt queſtion would not have been ſuch in the ſecond. However I gave ear to his reaſons, and ask'd him, Why they had ſet upon that propoſition? Are you ignorant, replyed he, how that Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> hath ever been cautious of ſaying any thing which was not ſtrongly gound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Tradition of the Church: That his adverſaries are nevertheleſs reſolv'd to cut him off from all benefit thereof upon any terms whatſoever; And conſequently the writings of the one giving no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the deſignes of the others, they have, to ſatisfie their paſſion, been forc'd to take any propoſition, and to condemn it, without giving any account wherein or wherefore? For do you not ſee, how the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> keep them ſtill at check, and proſecute them ſo violently, that upon the leaſt word they let fall againſt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Fathers, they are preſently overwhelm'd with whole volumes, or are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115411:37"/> forc'd to ſubmit? So that after ſo many diſcoveries of their weakneſs, they have thought it more eaſie and convenient to <hi>cenſure</hi> then to <hi>reply,</hi> becauſe it is leſs trouble to find <hi>Friers,</hi> then <hi>Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, ſaid I, if it be ſo, the cenſure ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing. For what credit will be given it, when it hath no ground, and is deſtroy'd by the anſwers may be made thereto? Did you reflect on the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people, ſayes the Doctor, you would ſpeak after another rate. Their Cenſure, how cenſurable ſoever it may be in it ſelf, will for a ſeaſon have its effect; and though it be certain there will be ſo much pains taken to ſhew its invalidity, that it will at laſt be diſcovered, yet is it withall true, that at the beginning, it will have as great an influence over the moſt, as if it were the juſteſt in the world. For there needs no more then to cry up and down the ſtreets; <hi>Come, buy the Cenſure againſt</hi> Arnauld. <hi>Here's the condemnation of the Janſeniſts;</hi> the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have their will. How few are there that will read it? How few of thoſe that do read it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it? How very few will perceive that it anſwers not the Objections? Who do you think will concern himſelf ſo much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115411:38"/> in the buſineſs as to undertake to examine it to the bottome? whence you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer how advantagious it will be to ſuch as are adverſaries to the <hi>Janſenists.</hi> They are ſure by this means to triumph, though as they are commonly wont, vainly, at leaſt for ſome moneths. And that's very much as the caſe ſtands with them, by that time they will have bethought them of ſome other ſhift to ſubſiſt. They live but from hand to mouth. By theſe ſleights have they kept above water all this time; as for inſtance, one while by a <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> wherein a child condemns their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: Another by a <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> leads the <hi>efficacious</hi> in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; one time by a <hi>Comedy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Devils carry away <hi>Janſenius;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an <hi>Almanack,</hi> and now by this <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In troth, ſaid I to him, I had erewhile much to object againſt this procedure of the <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> but having heard what you ſay, I admire their prudence and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. I now ſee they could not have done any thing more judiciouſly or more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely. You apprehend it right, ſaid he, their ſureſt way hath ever been to be ſilent; which haply gave a great Divine occaſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115411:38"/> to ſay, <hi>That the moſt able among them, are thoſe who plot much, speak little, and write nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'I was by the ſuggeſtion of this ſpirit, that in the very beginning of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they had prudently ordered, that if Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> came into <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> it ſhould be ſimply to diſcover what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, not to engage in diſpute with any one. The examiners not ſtrictly obſerving this method were a little at a loſs, whence h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ply it came they were ſo ſharply refuted by the ſecond <hi>Apologetick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the ſame Spirit have they deriv'd that rare and wholly new invention of the <hi>half-hour</hi> and the <hi>ſand.</hi> They have by that means prevented the importunity of thoſe tedious Doctors who thought it a certain pleaſure to refute their reaſons; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the books ſo to convince them of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; to preſs them to anſwer, and to reduce them to ſuch a non-plus that they had nothing to anſwer.</p>
               <p>Not but that they well ſaw that this want of freedome which had oblig'd ſo many Doctors to refrain the Aſſemblies, muſt ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ds derogate from the Cenſure, and that the act of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> would be an ill prologue to uſher in a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115411:39"/> reception of it. Nay they are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that thoſe who are not perſons to be begg'd, will give as great weight to the judgment of 70. Doctors, who could not expect to get any thing by defending Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> then to that of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred others who could loſe nothing by condemning him.</p>
               <p>But all conſider'd, they thought it no ſmall advantage to have a Cenſure out, though it were but of a part of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and not of the whole body; though it were paſſ'd with little or no freedome, and procur'd by little ſhifts, and thoſe not the moſt regular; though it explain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what might be in controverſie; though it expreſs not wherein this hereſie conſiſts; and that there is little ſaid in it, for fear of miſtake. Nay this ſilence is a myſterie to the ſimple, and the Cenſure will have this ſingular advantage thereby that the greateſt Criticks and ſubtileſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines cannot find any inſufficient reaſon in it.</p>
               <p>You may therefore clear up your thoughts of all fear of being an Heretick, for admitting and adhering to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd propoſition; it is not dangerous any where but in Monſieur <hi>Arnaulds</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115411:39"/> Letter. If you will not take my word, take Monſieur <hi>le Moines,</hi> the moſt violent of the Examiners, who, to a Doctor of my acquaintance asking him wherein the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in queſtion conſiſted, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were any longer lawful to ſay what the Fathers ſaid, made this reply, <hi>This propoſition were Catholick in any other mouth. 'Tis onely in that of Monſieur</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld <hi>that</hi> Sorbonne <hi>hath condemn'd it.</hi> Whence admire the ſtratagems of <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> whereby are wrought ſuch ſtrange hurly-burlies in the Church; That what was ſound and Catholick in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> becomes heretical in Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> that what was heretical in the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> proves orthodox in the writings of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits;</hi> that the ſo ancient Doctrine of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is inſupportable <hi>Novelty;</hi> and that the new <hi>Inventions</hi> which are hatch'd every day even before our eyes, paſs current for the ancient <hi>Faith</hi> of the Church. Upon this he took leave of me.</p>
               <p>This inſtruction hath reſtor'd me to my ſight. I learn by it that this hereſie is of a new kind; they are not the <hi>opinions</hi> of Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> that are heretical, 'tis onely his <hi>perſon.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>perſonal</hi> Hereſie.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115411:40"/> He's not an Heretick for any thing he hath either ſaid or written, but onely becauſe he is Monſieur <hi>Arnauld.</hi> This is all can be objected againſt him. Let him do what he will, he ſhall never be otherwiſe, till he ceaſe to be at all. The Grace neld by Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhall never be the true grace, while Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it. It would haply be ſuch, did he but once oppoſe it.

               <p>INcomparable men theſe <hi>Jeſuits!</hi> I have ſeen <hi>Dominicans,</hi> Doctors, nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of moſt qualities; I wanted onely this viſit to make me compleat. For I ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are but their <hi>Copies,</hi> and things are ever moſt noble in their <hi>Originals.</hi> I had the happineſs to meet with one of the moſt eminent among them, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company then that of my faithful <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſt,</hi> who was with me at the <hi>Dominicans.</hi> Being extremely deſirous to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd about the difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> concerning what they call <hi>actual grace;</hi> I addreſſed my ſelf to the good Father, deſiring him to afford me ſome little inſtruction, and explaine that <hi>terme</hi> whereof I told him I knew not the meaning. With all my heart, reply'd he; I have a particular affection for the curious. Take the definition of it.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115411:41"/> By <hi>actual grace,</hi> we mean, <hi>an inſpiration of God, whereby he diſcovers his will unto us, and ſtirs up in us a deſire to accompliſh it.</hi> And what controverſie, ſaid I, doth this breed between <hi>you</hi> and the <hi>Janſenists?</hi> This, reply'd he, that we would have God beſtow <hi>actuall graces</hi> on all men in every particular temptation; for we hold, that if a man have not in every temptation, that <hi>actual grace,</hi> to reſtrain him from ſinning, what ſin ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may commit cannot be imputed to him. On the contrary, the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that ſins committed without this preſence of <hi>actual grace,</hi> are nevertheleſs imputable. But they are a ſort of pittiful ſouls. I gueſſ'd at what he would ſay, yet to clear it a little more fully, Father, ſaid I to him, this terme of <hi>actual grace</hi> I know not how to digeſt, it's a meat I am not uſ'd to, would you but do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to tell me the ſame thing without uſing that terme, I ſhould think it a great obligation. To do that ſaid the Father, I am onely to put the <hi>definition</hi> inſtead of the <hi>definitum,</hi> that alters not the ſenſe of the diſcourſe; with all my heart. We hold then as an undeniable principle. <hi>That an action cannot be imputed as ſin, if God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be committed, give us not a knowledge
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115411:41"/> of the evil of it, and an inspiration exciting us to avoid it.</hi> Have I now expreſſ'd my ſelf home?</p>
               <p>I was not a little aſtoniſh'd at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; which granted, all ſins of <hi>ſurpriſe,</hi> and all committed out of a pure <hi>oblivion</hi> of God, are not to be imputed: whereupon turning to my <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> I knew by his countenance what little credit he gave it. But he continuing ſilent, Father, ſaid I, I wiſh what you ſay were true, and that you could make it good. How? ſaid he, you would have it prov'd? you ſhall be ſatisfied; be that upon my account. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he went for his Books, while I and my friend fell into diſcourſe. Did ever m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I did, and found theſe words, <hi>For a man to ſin, and ſtand guilty in the ſight of God, he muſt know that the thing he is about to do is naught, or at leaſt doubt, fear, or imagine that God takes no pleaſure in the action wherein he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, that he forbids it, and all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, to do it, to break through the hedge, and exceed his bounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A very good beginning, ſaid I to him. But note by the way what <hi>Envy</hi> is, reply'd he. This very paſſage gave Monſieur Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illor occaſion, before he became one of us, to abuſe Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> applying to him theſe words, <hi>Ecce qui tollit peccata mundi: Behold him that takes away the ſins of the world.</hi> It is, ſaid I, a new kind of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption this of Father <hi>Bauny</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>But would you have a more authentick proof, continu'd he? take this book of Father <hi>Annats.</hi> This is the laſt of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt Monſieur <hi>Arnauld,</hi> turn to pag. 34. where the leaf is turn'd down,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115411:42"/> and read the lines I have mark'd with black lead, they are golden ones. There I found theſe words, <hi>He who hath not any thought of God, nor yet of his own ſins, nor any apprehenſion,</hi> that is, as he explain'd it, any knowledge, <hi>of the obligation lies upon him to exerciſe acts of the love of God, or of contrition, hath no actual grace to exerciſe thoſe acts; but it muſt be alſo acknowledg'd, that he is not guilty of any ſin if he omit them, and that if he be damn'd, it will not be for any thing relating to that omiſſion.</hi> And ſome few lines lower, <hi>And the ſame thing may be affirm'd of ſins of commiſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See now, ſayes the Father, how he ſpeaks of the ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> he forgets nothing; what ſay you to it? I am extremely well ſatisfied, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd I; what excellent conſequences may be deduced from it, I am already over head and ears in them! O what what my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries am I rapt into! I ſee a far greater number juſtified by this <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs</hi> of God, then by <hi>Grace</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> But, Father, does this any more then bring me into a fools paradiſe?

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115411:43"/> there already, do you ſpeak ſincerely? How, ſaid the Father, a little enflam'd; this is no jeſting matter; here is not any equivocation. I am in earneſt, ſaid I to him; but the exceſs of my deſire it ſhould be ſo, puts me into ſome fear it may not.</p>
               <p>Take then for your better information, the writings of Monſieur <hi>le Moine,</hi> who hath taught it openly in <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed learnt it firſt from us, but he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell'd the buſineſs excellently well.

               <p>But all modern, whiſper'd my <hi>Janſaniſt.</hi> 'Tis very well, ſaid I, applying my ſelf to the Father.

Their life is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſtudy of all ſorts of pleaſures and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, never interrupted by the leaſt remorſe of Conſcience. From theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances I inferr'd their infallible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115411:44"/> but Father, you convince me, that they are ſo many demonſtrations of their ſalvation; happineſs be your reward for this excellent way of juſtification. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cure ſouls by painful auſterities; but you ſhew us, that thoſe who were thought the moſt deſperately ſick, are the beſt in health. O the excellent method of living happily both in this and the other world! I ever was of opinion that a man ſinned the more, the leſs he thought of God; but for ought I perceive now, when a man hath once learn'd the kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck of not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at all, things are in a ſecure po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture for the time to come. Away, away, <hi>half-ſinners,</hi> who have ſome little inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to virtue, inevitable damnation is their lot. But for theſe free ſinners, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ſinners, diſchequer'd ſinners, full and fat ſinners, Hell cannot hold them; they have cheated the Devil by complying with him.</p>
               <p>The Father perceiving well the connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of theſe conſequences, made an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome evaſion, and without ſhew of any diſturbance, either through good nature or prudence; that you may ſee, ſaid he, how we ſalve all theſe inconveniences, know we affirme, that all theſe impious
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115411:44"/> perſons you ſpeak of, ſhould be without ſin, if they never had had thoughts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or deſires to apply themſelves to God. But we hold that they all have, and that God never ſuffered any man to ſin, having not before given him a ſight of the evil he intends to commit; and withal a deſire either to avoid the ſin, or at leaſt to implore his aſſiſtance to enable him to ſhun it; and there are none but <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts</hi> that affirme the contrary.</p>
               <p>How, Father, reply'd I, is that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> of the <hi>Janſenists,</hi> to deny that at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time a man commits a ſin, a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe troubles his Conſcience, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, a man ſticks not, as Father <hi>Bauny</hi> ſayes, <hi>to break through the hedge, and exceed his bounds?</hi> It's very pleaſant a man ſhould be an <hi>Heretick</hi> for this. I thought men had been damn'd for not having good thoughts, but that they ſhould for not believing that all the world have, is a thing I muſt confeſs never came into my thoughts.</p>
               <p>But Father, I think my ſelf oblig'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to undeceive you; and tell you, there are thouſands have not theſe deſires, ſin without the leaſt regret, and do both rejoyce and glory in it. And for this I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115411:45"/> to your ſelf, who muſt needs know it well. No queſtion but you hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſome of thoſe I ſpeak of, for it is among perſons of quality that it ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily happens. But Father look you to the dangerous conſequences of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Do you not perceive what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it may have on thoſe <hi>Libertines</hi> who make it their buſineſs to raiſe doubts about Religion it ſelf? what advantages do you give them, when you tell them, as an article of Faith, that at the commiſſion of every ſin, they feel a certain mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſire to eſchew it? For is it not evident, that being, by their own experience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that your doctrine is erroneous even as to that point which you ſay is of faith, they will extend the conſequences of it to all the reſt? They will ſay, that if you are not orthodoxal in one article, you are to be miſtruſted in all; and ſo they will be forc'd to conclude, either that Religion is falſe, or that you are but ſlenderly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in it.</p>
               <p>But my ſecond taking up my diſcourſe, it were, Father, ſaid he, more for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of your doctrine, not to make ſo obvious an interpretation, as you have done, of what you mean by <hi>actual grace.</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:115411:45"/> For how can you but expect to meet with the incredulity of many, if you openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That no man ſins but he hath before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the knowledge of his infirmity, as alſo that of his phyſician, with the deſire of being cur'd, and that of begging it at Gods hands?</hi> Will it be believ'd, upon your word, that thoſe who are immerſ'd in Avarice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity, blaſphemy, quarrels, revenge, robberies, Sacriledges, have any reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to embrace chaſtity, humility, and the other Chriſtian virtues?</p>
               <p>Can any one imagine that thoſe <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> who ſo highly celebrated the power of nature knew the infirmities and the cure of it? Will you affirm that thoſe who maintain'd it as an undeniable Maxime, <hi>that virtue is not the gift of God, and that there never was any perſon that crav'd it of him,</hi> ever bethought them to ask it of him themſelves?</p>
               <p>Who can believe that the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who did not acknowledge <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> had any motions to pray unto God? when they affirm'd, that <hi>our addreſſes to him are derogatory to his Majeſty, as if it were below him to trouble himſelf with any thoughts of us or our neceſſities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, how can it be imagin'd that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115411:46"/> 
                  <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> can have, in all their temptations, that is, an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of times in their life, any inclination to pray to the true God, whom they know not, to beſtow on them the true virtues they are ignorant of.</p>
               <p>All this, ſayes the good Father very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, we ſhall affirm, and rather then acknowledge that a man can ſin and not have the ſight of his evil-doing, and an inclination to the contrary virtue, we ſhall maintaine, that all the world, even <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> have theſe inſpirations and deſires in every temptation. For you cannot, at leaſt by the Scripture, make it appear otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Upon this I reſum'd the diſcourſe. How, ſaid I, Father, muſt we appeal to <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> to evince a thing ſo evident? This is no point of faith, nor indeed of ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but meerly matter of fact; we ſee, know, and feel it.</p>
               <p>But my <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> cloſing with the Father upon his own termes, If you will not, ſaid he to him, be ſatisfied with any thing but Scripture, be it ſo: but I pray oppoſe it not, and ſince it is written, <hi>That God hath not reveal'd his judgments to the Gentiles, and hath ſuffered them to erre in their own
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115411:46"/> wayes,</hi> do not affirme that God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned thoſe, whom the holy Writ aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, <hi>to have been left in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Does it not ſufficiently convince you that your principle is erroneous, to ſee that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf the <hi>chiefeſt of ſinners,</hi> for a ſin which he profeſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>out of ignorance, not without zeal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not the <hi>Gospel</hi> clear enough, that thoſe who crucified <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſtood in need of the pardon he begg'd for them, though they were not ſenſible of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their action, and that, according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> they had never done it if they had known ſo much?</p>
               <p>Is it not Chriſts forewarning us, that there will be thoſe that ſhall p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce in their endeavours to ruine it, enough to let us underſtand, that this ſin, which, according to the Apoſtle, is the greateſt, may be committed by ſuch as are ſo far from knowing they offend, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhould if they did it not? In a word, is it not enough that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf hath taught us, that there are two kinds of ſinners, one ſinning with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the other without, yet ſhall be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115411:47"/> both puniſh'd, though in a different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
               <p>The good Father preſſ'd by ſo many proofs out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereto he had appeal'd, began to give ground, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting impious perſons to ſin without inſpiration, you will not certainly deny, ſaid he, that the <hi>Righteous</hi> never ſin but God gives them — You retreat, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, Father ſaid I to him, and quit the general principle; and perceiving that it holds not in reſpect to ſinners, you would compound the buſineſs, and make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to the <hi>Righteous.</hi> But, that grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the advantage you will make of it will be very inconſiderable, for the benefit of it will reach to very few; inſomuch that it is not worth the diſputing for.</p>
               <p>But my ſecond, who had, as I conceive, by his readineſs to take all advantages, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the queſtion very much that morning, gave him this anſwer. You are now, ſaid he to him, gotten into that redoubt which all of your party that run the hazard of a diſpute are forc'd to: but you lie as open to all aſſault as ever, for your example of the juſt is ſoon defeated. Who makes it any queſtion but that even they very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall into ſins of ſurpriſe, and when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115411:47"/> they are not ſenſible of it. Do we not learn even from the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelvs what trap-doors concupiſcence laie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed onely on neceſſity, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> acknowledgeth of himſelf in his <hi>Confeſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ordinary is it to ſee even the moſt zealous tranſported with paſſion &amp; bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in diſpute through an over-reflection on their own intereſts; though their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences give them not at that time any other notice ſave that they behave themſelves ſo out of a tenderneſs to truth, and they themſelves are not ſenſible of it till a long time after?</p>
               <p>But what will be ſaid of thoſe who are violently inclin'd to things really bad, as believing them really good, (whereof we have many inſtances in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtory) which yet hinders not, but that as the Fathers hold, they have ſinn'd in thoſe occaſions?</p>
               <p>Moreover, this not granted, how could the righteous be guilty of <hi>ſecret</hi> ſins? How ſhould it be true that God alone knows their greatneſs and number? inſomuch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115411:48"/> that no man knows whether he deſerve love or hatred, and that the greateſt Saints ſhould alwayes walk <hi>in fear and trembling,</hi> even though they find not themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any thing, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes of himſelf.</p>
               <p>You are therefore to conceive, Father, that the examples as well of the <hi>righteous</hi> as <hi>ſinners</hi> do equally overthrow the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity you ſuppoſe there is in ſin, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil, and loving the contrary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſince the earneſtneſs of impious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their vices, ſufficiently diſcovers they have not the leaſt inclination to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and that the affection which the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous have for vertue, argues very much that they have not alwayes a knowledge of the ſins they daily commit, as is clear out of Scripture.</p>
               <p>And that the righteous do ſin after this manner it is ſo certain, that it ſeldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens great Saints offend otherwiſe. For how can it be imagin'd that thoſe ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſouls, which with ſo much ardor and averſion, ſhun the leaſt things that may diſpleaſe God, as ſoon as they are ſenſible of it, and who yet commit many ſins daily, ſhould have every time, before they fell, <hi>the knowledge of their infirmity on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115411:48"/> as alſo that of their Phyſician, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the deſires of their health and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for his aſſiſtance;</hi> and that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe inſpirations, theſe zealous ſouls cannot but <hi>exceed their bounds,</hi> and commit the ſin?</p>
               <p>Conclude then, Father, that neither ſinners, nor yet the righteous have alwayes theſe knowledges, theſe deſires, and all theſe inſpirations as often as they ſin; that is, to uſe your terme, have not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The good Father perceiving his opinion almoſt defeated as well in regard of the righteous as ſinners, would not yet quit the field; well, ſaid he, after a little meditation, I have forces enough to rout you yet.

This is the firſt time, ſaid I to them, that ever I knew you agree about any thing; if you value my advice, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, go no further. That would amount to nothing, ſaid he; for we are to know what conditions are requiſite to make an action <hi>voluntary.</hi> I am extremely afraid, anſwer'd I, that you will fall out about it. Fear nothing ſaid he, the caſe is clear, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is on my ſide. Pray mark what Father <hi>Bauny</hi> ſayes; <hi>That an action be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, it is requiſite it ſhould proceed from a man that ſees, that knows, that conſiders well what there is of good, what of evill in it. Voluntarium eſt,</hi> ſay we commonly with this Philoſopher (you know, ſaid he to me, wringing me by the hand, who <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> is) <hi>quod fit à principio cognoſcente ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula in quibus eſt actio. So that when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115411:49"/> the will is at randome and without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, inclined to deſire, or abhor, to do, or omit a thing, before the understanding could poſſibly come in to ſee whether the evil of it were in proſecuting or eſchewing it, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not doing of it, ſuch an action is neither good nor evil, in as much as before that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, that ſight and reflection of the mind upon the good and bad qualities of the thing wherein a man is employ'd, the action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is done is not voluntary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, ſaid the Father, are you not yet ſatisfied? I ſhould think, reply'd I, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of Father <hi>Bauny's</hi> opinion, yet can I not but much wonder at it. How, Father, to act voluntarily, is it not enough that the Agent knows what he does, and that he does it not but becauſe he will do it? but it ſeems, it is further requiſite, <hi>that he ſee, that he know, &amp; conſider well what there is of good and evil in the action.</hi> This granted, humane life will afford but few <hi>voluntary</hi> actions, for a man ſeldome thinks of all this. How many oaths in gaming, exceſſes and extravagances in our debauches and enjoyments, which being not voluntary, are conſequently neither good nor bad, becauſe not attended by theſe reflections of the mind upon the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115411:50"/> good and bad qualities of what a man does? But is it poſſible, Father, that this ſhould come from <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> I have heard ſay, he was a very excellently learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Ile clear up the buſineſs to you, ſayes my <hi>Janſeniſt.</hi> Whereupon calling for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotles</hi> Ethicks, he opened it at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third book, whence Father <hi>Bauny</hi> had taken the words he had cited out of him: Father, ſaid he, I excuſe you for taking it upon the credit of Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of this opinion; but you would have been of another mind, had you read him your ſelf. 'Tis very true he teaches, <hi>that to make an action volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a man ſhould know the particularities of that action, ſingula in quibus eſt actio.</hi> But what does he mean by this, but the particular circumſtances of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? as the inſtances he gives clearly demonſtrate, he producing none but thoſe of ſuch as are ignorant of ſome one of the circumſtances; as that <hi>of a perſon, who being to ſhew an engine, lets flye a dart out of it and caſually hurts ſome body; and that of</hi> Meropus, <hi>who kill'd his own ſon, when he thought to have kill'd his enemy;</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Hence you may perceive what kind of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115411:50"/> 
                  <hi>Ignorance</hi> that is which makes an action <hi>involuntary,</hi> and that is no other then that of the particular circumſtances, called by <hi>Divines,</hi> as you very well know, Father, <hi>the ignorance of the fact.</hi> But for that <hi>of right,</hi> that is the ignorance of the good and evil which are in an action, whereof the preſent diſcourſe is, let us ſee whether <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be of Father <hi>Bauny</hi>'s opinion. Theſe are the words of the Philoſopher. <hi>All impious perſons are ignorant of what they ſhould do, and what they ſhould avoid; and this is the very thing that makes them impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked. It cannot therefore be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that, becauſe a man is ignorant of what in prudence he ought to do, to perform his duty, his action is involuntary: For this ignorance which conſiſts in the election of good and evil, does not cauſe an action to be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, but onely makes it vicious. The ſame thing may by ſaid of him who is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ignorant of the rules of his duty, ſince ſuch an ignorance renders him blame-worthy and uncapable of excuſe. In like manner the ignorance which makes actions involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and excuſable, is onely that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards matter of fact in particular, and in its ſingular circumſtances. For then, a man is pardoned, and excuſed, and look'd on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115411:51"/> as a perſon that hath done a thing againſt his will.</hi>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of your opinion? And who but may very well be aſtoniſh'd, to ſee a <hi>heathen</hi> Philoſopher more illuminated, then your <hi>Doctors,</hi> in a buſineſs, wherein not only <hi>Morality,</hi> but even the conduct of mens ſouls is ſo highly concern'd, as that of the knowledg of the conditions which make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions voluntary, or involuntary, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently render them excuſable or inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable as to matter of ſin?

They have chang'd the face of all Chriſtendome.</hi> This muſt be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115411:52"/> believ'd when they affirme it; you ſhall find it ſo in the ſequel of this diſcourſe, which will acquaint you with their Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes.</p>
               <p>I have taken a great deal of paines to informe my ſelf, as being not over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of what I had learn'd of my friend. I would needs be an ocular witneſs, but am ſatisfied he told me nothing but what was true. I think he is never miſtaken, as you ſhall find by the account you have of theſe conferences.</p>
               <p>In that I had with my friend, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd me with things ſo infinitely pleaſant that my Faith was as the eye of a needle in reſpect of a Camel; but ſhewing them to me in the Fathers books, I had nothing to ſay by way of alleviation, but that they were the ſentiments of ſome few among them, which it were not juſt to charge the whole body with. To give it the more weight, I aſſur'd him of my acquaintance with ſome of them as remarkable for their ſeverity as thoſe he quoted were for their circumſpection. With that he drew the curtain and diſcover'd the interiour of the <hi>Society,</hi> known to few in the world, which haply you will be glad to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:115411:53"/>
               <p>You imagine, ſaid he to me, that you have done them abundance of right by ſhewing that there are ſome Fathers among them as conformable to evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal maximes as others are diſconſonant, and thence conclude that theſe extravagant opinions ought not to be put upon the ſcore of the whole ſociety. I eaſily grant it. For if they were, they would not ſuffer among them ſuch as ſhould be ſo contrary thereunto. But ſince there are among them ſuch as advance princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo licentious, there's the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to infer, that the ſpirit of the ſociety is not that of Chriſtian auſterity. For if it were, they would not admit members that ſhould ſo much oppoſe it. What then, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd I, is the main deſign of the whole body? It muſt certainly be thought they have not any aſſured ſcope, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is at liberty to ſpeak at randome what he thinks. That cannot be, reply'd he; ſuch a vaſt body cannot ſubſiſt by a temerarious conduct, and without a ſoul to diſpoſe and regulate its motions: Beſides that there is a particular order among them that nothing be printed without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with their ſuperiours. But how, ſaid I, can the ſame ſuperiours approve
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115411:53"/> 
                  <hi>Maximes</hi> ſo different? That, reply'd he, I ſhall eaſily clear up to you.</p>
               <p>Know then, that they do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the corruption of good manners; no, that's not their deſigne; but note withall, that it is not their main drift to reforme them. That were no good policy. Take then their grounds. They are ſo well opinion'd of themſelves as to believe, it is for the advantage and benefit of Religion that their reputation be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and that they have the diſpoſal of all Conſciences. And whereas the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of Evangelical ſeverity are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the government of ſome, they make uſe of them upon ſuch occaſions as contribute to their deſign; but the ſame maximes being not equally ſerviceable as to a many others, when they are to deal with ſuch, they omit them, that ſo they may comply with all.</p>
               <p>Being therefore engag'd to deal with all ſorts of persons, &amp; thoſe of ſeveral conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; nations, it is but requiſite they ſhould have <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſuitable to this diverſity.</p>
               <p>From this principle you may eaſily judge, that if they had not any but theſe licentious <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> their main deſign wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115411:54"/> the world, ſince thoſe who are truly pious put themſelves under another conduct. But as there are not many of this humour, ſo need they but few ſevere directions to guide them. Few ſheep require fewer ſhepherds; whereas the ſwarm of remiſs Caſuits are employ'd to ſatisfie thoſe who ſeek after remiſneſs and Liberty.</p>
               <p>It is by this <hi>obliging and complying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> as Father <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avius</hi> calls it, that they embrace all the world. For if there come to them one reſolv'd to make reſtitution of goods unjuſtly gotten, it is not to be fear'd they will divert him. On the contrary, they will encourage and confirm him in ſo holy a reſolution. But let another come who would be abſolv'd without reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it ſhall go very hard but they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way to diſmiſs him well ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Thus do they preſerve their friends and oppoſe their enemies. For if they are charged with any more then ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs, they immediately bring upon the ſtage their auſtere directors, and certain books they have publiſh'd concerning the rigour of the Chriſtian law; and the ſimple, and thoſe who make no deep ſcrutinies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things, patiently ſwallow it down for good ſatisfaction.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:115411:54"/>
               <p>Thus are they furniſh'd for all cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and anſwer ſo pertinently what they are ask'd, that when they are in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where the belief of a <hi>crucified</hi> God is accounted extravagance, they ſmother the ſcandall of the Croſs, and preach up a glorified <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not a ſuffering <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ.</hi> This courſe they took in the <hi>Indies</hi> and in <hi>China,</hi> where they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Chriſtians to commit Idolatry, by a ſubtile invention, <hi>viz.</hi> that of injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to hide under their cloths an image of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to which they teach them, by a mental reſervation, to direct thoſe publick adorations, which they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Idol <hi>Oachim-choan,</hi> and their <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um-fucum,</hi> as <hi>Gravina,</hi> a Dominican laies it to their charge, and as may be ſeen in certain papers in the Span ſh tongue, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> of the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, cited by <hi>Thomas Hurtado</hi> in his book <hi>of Martyrdome for the Faith,</hi> pag. 427. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Congregation of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, <hi>de propagandâ fide,</hi> was forced to give the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> a particular prohibition, that they ſhould not, under any pretence whatſoever, upon pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, permit thoſe idolatrous adorations,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115411:55"/> and ſo conceal the myſterie of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> from thoſe they inſtructed in Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; enjoyning them expreſly not to admit any to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> till after that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as alſo to expoſe in their Churches the image of the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Decree of that <hi>Congregation,</hi> dated the 9. of <hi>July</hi> 1646. ſigned by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Caponi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe means do they, like Locuſts, cover the face of the earth, with the help of a Monſter called, <hi>The doctrine of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinions,</hi> the ſource of this torrent of irregularities. This you muſt underſtand from themſelves. For they are not ſo ſhie as to conceal it from any, no more then what you have already heard, with this difference nevertheleſs, that they diſguiſe their humane prudence and policy under the notion of Divine and Chriſtian wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as if Faith, and the Tradition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is maintained, were not alwayes the ſame and unchangeable in all times and all places; as if the rule ſhould apply it ſelf to the thing that is to be meaſur'd by it; and as if ſouls, to be cleanſ'd from their imperfections, were onely to corrupt the Law of the Lord, whereas <hi>the Law of the Lord is holy and without blemiſh, ſuch as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115411:55"/> doth convert ſouls,</hi> and make them confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his ſaving inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Do but go among thoſe good Fathers, and I am confident, your own obſervation will ſatisfie you, that their doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Grace</hi> proceeds from looſneſs in <hi>Morality.</hi> You will find Chriſtian virtues ſuch ſtrangers, both to them and charity, whereby they live and are inform'd; you will finde ſuch palliations of crimes, and ſuch diſorders countenanc'd, that it will be no longer a miracle to you, their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that all men have at all times grace enough to live piouſly, as they underſtand it. But their Morality not exceeding that of Pagans, it is within the reach of Nature to obſerve it. When we affirme a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>efficacious grace,</hi> we aſſign other virtues for its object. It is not ſimply to cure ſome vices by others; it is not onely to engage men in the exerciſes of the external duties of Religion; it is to arrive at a higher virtue then that of the Phariſees, and the wiſeſt Heathens. The law and reaſon are graces ſufficient to produce theſe effects. But to diſingage the ſoul from the love of this world; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of what ſhe thinks deareſt; to work in her a ſelf-mortification; to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115411:56"/> and unite her abſolutely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably to her God; this, this is not the work of any but an Almighty hand.

               <p>This was his diſcourſe, burthened with abundance of paſſion, for he is extremely troubled at theſe diſorders. For my part, I had a certain eſteem for theſe good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the excellency of their <hi>Politicks;</hi> and ſo, according to his advice I went to an honeſt Caſuiſt of the Society, whom having known a long time, I thought this a good occaſion to renew my acquaintance with him. Being well enough inſtructed how they are to be treated; I found it no hard matter to do it. His entertainment was infinitely kind, for he loves me ſtill; and after ſome indifferent diſcourſe, I took occaſion, from the ſeaſon we now are in, to learn ſomething of him concerning <hi>Faſting,</hi> ſo to enter inſenſibly into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. I told him it was very burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to me to faſt; he exhorted me to do my ſelf a little violence, but I continuing

He indeed found a many, which yet I could not make any advantage of, till at laſt he bethought him to ask me, whether, going to bed ſupperleſs, I was not much troubled to ſleep. I am indeed, Father, ſaid I, which forces me many times to make a collation at noone, and ſup at night.

Father <hi>Bauny</hi> holds the negative. <hi>They,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ought not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied abſolution, who remain in the very next degrees to ſinning, if they are in ſuch a condition that they cannot quit them without giving the world occaſion to talke of them, or running into ſome inconvenience thereby.</hi> You tell me very good news, Father, ſaid I, there's no more now to be ſaid, but that a man may make it his buſineſs to ſeek out thoſe opportunities, ſince it is lawful for him not to avoid them. Nay it is lawful to do ſo, added he; the famous Caſuiſt

Then, ſaid I, you ſpeak againſt your conſcience? Not at all, ſaid he; I did not ſpeak in that according to my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but according to that of <hi>Pontius</hi> and Father <hi>Bauny.</hi> And you may ſafely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low where they lead, for they are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men. How, Father, becauſe they have put theſe three lines into their books, ſhall it be lawful to ſeek the opportunities of ſinning?

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115411:59"/> ſatisfied with probability. I look for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I ſee then, ſayes the good Father, you underſtand nothing of the <hi>Doctrine of Probable Opinions,</hi> which if you did, you would talk after another rate. I muſt needs take a little pains with you, as to that point, you will not repent your coming hither, for without that, you can underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it being the foundation, and <hi>A.

Our Authors, ſaid he, will give you a better accout of it then I can. Thus they generally deſcribe it all, and among others our twenty four. <hi>An Opinion is then called probable, when it is grounded upon reaſons of ſome conſideration. Whence it ſometimes comes to paſs, that the authority of one grave Doctor may render an opinion probable.</hi> The reaſon this; <hi>That a man abſolutely devoted to ſtudy, would not maintain an opinion, if he were not induc'd to do it, by a good and ſufficient reaſon.</hi> Which granted, ſaid I, one onely Doctor may turn mens conſciences topſie turvy, and yet all will be ſecure. You muſt neither laugh at, nor think to oppoſe this doctrine; the

Mark what <hi>Sanchez,</hi> one of the moſt eminent of our Fathers, ſayes; <hi>You haply queſtion whether the authority of one good and learned Doctor renders an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion probable? To Which I anſwer, it does. And this is affirmed by</hi> Angelus, Sylv. Navarr. Emanuel Sa. &amp;c. <hi>It is thus prov'd. A probable opinion is that which is grounded upon ſomething conſiderable, But the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a knowing and godly man is of no ſmall conſideration, but rather of great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For, take the reaſon along with you; <hi>if the teſtimony of ſuch a man be of great weight to aſſure us that ſuch a thing happened, for inſtance, at</hi> Rome, <hi>why ſhall it not have the ſame effect in a queſtion of Morality?</hi>

               <p>Father, ſaid I, to deal freely with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall not ſtand to this rule. What aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance have I, that your Doctors taking ſo much freedome to examine things by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what ſeems certain to one will ſeem ſuch to all the reſt, there being ſuch a ſtrange diverſity of judgments; — You underſtand not the caſe, ſayes the Father, interrupting my diſcourſe; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed often of ſeveral opinions, but that breaks no ſquares. Every one makes his own good and probable. There's nothing ſo clear as that they are not all of the ſame judgment; nay, on the contrary, they never almoſt agree, and yet all this makes for the beſt. There are few queſtions, wherein one does not hold the <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> the other the <hi>negative,</hi> yet in all theſe caſes both the one and the other of the <hi>contradictory</hi> opinions, is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whence <hi>Diana</hi> upon a certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaid, <hi>Pontius and Zanchez are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions, but, being both learned men, either makes his opinion probable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Father, ſaid I, a man muſt needs be at a great loſs which to embrace. Not at all, ſayes he, he is onely to follow the opinion he is moſt inclin'd to. What though the other be the more probable?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115411:60"/> It matters not, ſaid he. And the other more certaine? It matters not, ſayes the Father again; take it explain'd by <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Sa,</hi> of our Society. <hi>A man may do what he conceives lawful, according to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion, though the contrary be the more certain. For this the opinion of one grave Doctor is ſufficient.</hi> But if an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be both leſs probable and leſs certain, may a man lawfully follow it, diſcarding what he believes more probable and more ſure? Once more, he may, ſaid he: hear <hi>Filiutius,</hi> that great <hi>Jeſuit</hi> of <hi>Rome. It is lawful to follow the leſs probable opinion, though it be the leſs certain. It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the more modern Authors.</hi> Are you not ſatisfied? We are indeed now at randome, Father, ſaid I, gramercy your <hi>probable opinions.</hi> This is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>liberty of conſcience.</hi> But for you <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts,</hi> may you take the ſame freedome in your Anſwers? We do, ſayes he, and ſo anſwer what we think good, or rather what we conceive will prove moſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to thoſe that ask us. For theſe are our directions, taken out of our Fathers, <hi>Layman, Vaſquez, Sanchez,</hi> and our 24. Theſe are the words of <hi>Layman,</hi> whom the book of our 24 hath followed. <hi>A
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115411:61"/> Doctor being conſulted, may give an advice, not onely ſuch as is probable according to his own opinion, but what is contrary to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if ſo it be accounted probable by others, especially when this advice, though contrary to his judgment, happens to be more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and more for the intereſt of him that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults him;</hi> (Si fortè haec illi favorabilior ſeu exoptatior ſit.) <hi>But I hold further, that it will be prudence in him, to giue thoſe who come to him, ſuch advice as is held as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by ſome knowing perſon, though he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis very true, ſayes he, and we may at any time ſay with <hi>Diana,</hi> who, having Father <hi>Bauny</hi> for him, when Father <hi>Lugo</hi> was againſt him, ſaid, <hi>Sapè premente Deo, fert D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I am illuminated, ſaid I; yet ſtill there ſticks one thing in my ſtomach. When a man hath conſulted one of your Doctors, and received from him an opinion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too large, he will be meerly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pann'd, if he meet a Confeſſor, who, not being of the ſame, will deny him abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if he alter not his judgment. Have you made no proviſion in that caſe? Do you queſtion it, reply'd he? All Confeſſors are oblig'd to abſolve their penitents hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing probable opinions, under pain of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin, the more to mind them of their duty, this is clear out of our Fathers, and among others, Father <hi>Bauny. When the patient,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>follows a probable opinion, the Confeſſor is bound to abſolve him, though his judgment be contrary to that of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> But he does not affirm it a mortal ſin not to abſolve him. How ready you are to catch? ſayes he, take what follows; he categorically concludes, <hi>That to deny abſolution to a penitent who walks according to a probable opinion, is a ſin, in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mortal.</hi> And to confirm this opinion he cites three of our moſt eminent Fathers, <hi>Suarez, Vaſquez,</hi> and <hi>Sanchez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Father, ſaid I, with what prudence do you order all things! We need not fear
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115411:62"/> any thing now, the Confeſſor muſt do his duty. I knew not before that you had the power to ordain any thing under pain of <hi>Damnation.</hi> I thought your Commiſſion reach'd no further then to take away ſins, &amp; never imagin'd you could introduce any. But for ought I ſee you are omnipotent. You do not ſpeak properly, ſaid he; we do not introduce ſins, we onely take notice of them. I have already obſerv'd twice or thrice that you are no good School-man. Howere it be, Father, ſaid I, I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as to that doubt, but I have another to propoſe to you, which is, that I know not what ſhift to make when the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> are contrary to the opinions of any of your <hi>Caſuiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are extremely to ſeek in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaid he. The <hi>Fathers</hi> were good for the Morality of their times; but they are far ſhort of that of ours. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be regulated by them, but by the new <hi>Caſuiſts.</hi> Hear our Father <hi>Cellot,</hi> who, as to this point, ſeconds our famous Father <hi>Reginaldus; In Queſtions of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality the modern Caſuiſts are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the ancient Fathers, though they were neerer the times of the Apoſtles.</hi> And it is according to this tenent, that <hi>Diana</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:115411:62"/> ſpeaks after this manner: <hi>Are benefic'd perſons oblig'd to make restitution of their revenue, when they miſ-imploy it? The Ancients affirm'd they were, but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern hold they are not; let us not therefore quit this opinion which acquits a man from the obligation of making reſtitution.</hi> Theſe are excellent good words, ſaid I, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with conſolations for the goods of this world. For the Fathers, ſaid he, we deliver them up to thoſe that handle <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Divinity,</hi> but for us who govern mens <hi>conſciences,</hi> we ſeldome read them, and, in our writings quote only the modern <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts.</hi> What an extravagant writer is our <hi>Diana!</hi> There is before his books a lift of all the Authors he cites. There you will find two hundred ninety and ſix, whereof the moſt ancient is within eighty years. This then is an humour come into the world ſince your Society, ſaid I: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, reply'd he. My meaning, Father, is, that at your appearance, Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and the reſt, vaniſh'd out of ſight, as to matter of <hi>Morality.</hi> But I would fain know the names of thoſe that have ſucceeded them; who are thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors? They are very excellent
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115411:63"/> men, and very famous, ſaid he; They are, <hi>Villalobos, Conink, Llamas, Achokier, Dealkozer, Dellacruz, Vera-Cruz, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Tambourin, Fernandez, Martinez, Suarez, Henriquez, Vaſquez, Lopez, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez, Sanchez, De Vecchis, De Graſſis, De Graſſalis, De Pitigianis, De Graphacis, Squilanti, Bizozeri, Barcola, De Boba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla, Simancha, Perez, De Lara, Aldret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Lorca, De Scarcia, Quaranta, Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra, Pedrezza, Cabrezza, Biſbe, Dias, De Clavaſio, Villagut, Adam à Manden, Itibarn, Binsfeld, Volfangi à Vorberg, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthery, Streueſdorf.</hi> O Father, ſaid I, a little frightned, were all theſe <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> How, Chriſtians, reply'd he? Did I not tell you that theſe are the men by whom we govern Chriſtendome at this day? This ſomewhat troubled me, but not diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of diſturbance, I onely ask'd him whether all thoſe Authors were <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its.</hi> No, ſaid he, but it matters not, they have left excellent things behind them. Not but that the greateſt part of them have either derived from, or imitated our Fathers; but we ſtand not upon termes of honour: Beſides, they cite our Fathers ever and anon, and that very honourably. Thus <hi>Diana,</hi> who is not of our Society,

On the contrary, we heartily wiſh others, beſides the Jeſuits, were able to render their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions probable, that all ſuch might not be imputed to us. And when any Author whatſoever hath advanc'd any one, we have a right to take it by the doctrine of <hi>probable opinions,</hi> yet ſo that we are not accountable for it, when the Author is not of our body.

For I brought a Table-book with me, to ſet down the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of paſſages, being not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled I had not done it the firſt time.

               <p>The good Father's diſcourſe was to this effect. One of the wayes whereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile

But we underſtand, by the word Murtherers, thoſe, who have receiv'd money to kill any one treacherouſly. Whence it comes to paſs, that thoſe who kill without receiving any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but do it onely to oblige their friends, are not called Murtherers.</hi> In like manner, it is ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>Give Almes of your ſuperfluities.</hi>

                  <hi>ſuperfluities,</hi> how will you anſwer it? It may be anſwer'd, ſaid he, that both theſe wayes are equally ſecure according to the ſame Goſpel; one, according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in the more literal, and more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe; the other according to the ſame Goſpel interpreted by <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> Whence you ſee the benefit of theſe <hi>interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the termes are ſo clear as not to admit any explanation, then we <hi>make the beſt advantage we can of the moſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable circumſtances,</hi> as you ſhall ſee in this example. The Popes have excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Religious men that quit their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and yet our 24 Ancients ſtick not to diſcourſe thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 704. <hi>In what caſes may a Religious man quit his habit without running the hazard of Excommunication?</hi> He inſtances in many, and among others this. <hi>If he quit it upon ſome infamous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as for to go and ſteal, or to go,</hi> incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitò, <hi>to uncivil places, as the Stews, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to reſume it again as ſoon as he hath done.</hi> And indeed it is evident the <hi>Bulls</hi> mention not any of theſe caſes.</p>
               <p>This I could hardly believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreated the Father to ſhew it me in the original, and found that the Chapter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115411:66"/> wherein theſe words are, is intituled; <hi>The Practice according to the School of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus, Praxis ex Societatis Jeſu ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lâ:</hi> and here I found theſe words, <hi>ſi habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dimittat, ut furetur occultè, vel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicetur.</hi> The ſame thing he alſo ſhewed me out of <hi>Diana,</hi> in theſe termes, <hi>ut eat incognitus ad Lupanar.</hi> But how comes it, Father, ſaid I, that they acquit them of excommunication in this caſe? Do you not apprehend the reaſon, ſaid he? Do you not perceive how ſcandalous it were to ſurpriſe a religious man in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his religious habit on? And have you not heard what anſwer was made to the firſt Bull, <hi>Contra ſollicitantes?</hi> And how our twenty four in a particular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>Of the Practiſe of the School of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> explain the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius Quintus, Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tra Clericos,</hi> &amp;c. I know nothing of all this, reply'd I. Then you are not much verſ'd in <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> ſaid he. I had it not till yeſterday, ſaid I, and I had much ado to find one. I know not what is happen'd lately, that all the world enquires after him. No other reaſon, reply'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then what I told you, in <hi>pag.</hi> 117. ſee it at your leiſure. You will there find an excellent example of the manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115411:67"/> 
                  <hi>Bulls</hi> favourably. I indeed look'd into him that very night, but I dare not give you any account of it, 'tis a thing ſo horrid and abominable.</p>
               <p>The good Father proceeded in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. You now underſtand what uſe we make of <hi>favourable circumſtances.</hi> But there are ſometimes ſuch as are ſo preciſe, that they contribute nothing to the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of the contradictions, inſomuch that in ſuch a caſe you might well think there really were ſome. For example; three Popes have decided, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, who, by a particular vow, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to obſerve a quadrageſimal life, are not diſpenſ'd of that vow, though they ſhould be made Biſhops. And yet <hi>Diana</hi> ſayes, <hi>that notwithſtanding their deciſion they are dispenſ'd of it.</hi> How, I pray, does he ſalve it, ſaid I? By the moſt ſubtile of all the <hi>new methods,</hi> reply'd the Father, and the moſt refin'd part of <hi>Probability.</hi> Ile explain it to you: It is as you obſerv'd the other day, that both the affirmative and negative of moſt opinions have a certain probability, according to the judgment of our Doctors, that is, enough to induce a man to follow them with a ſafe conſcience. Not that the <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:115411:67"/> are equally true in the ſame ſenſe, that be ng impoſſible, but onely that they are probable, and ſecure in their conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>According to this principle it is, that our good Friend <hi>Diana</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>part</hi> 5. <hi>tr.</hi> 13. <hi>R.</hi> 39. <hi>As to the deciſion of theſe three Popes, ſince it is contrary to my opinion; I anſwer, that they have spoken in that manner out of their inclination to the affirmative, which indeed is probable, even in my judgment; but it does not follow thence but that the negative may alſo have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.</hi> And in the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>R.</hi> 65. upon another occaſion, wherein, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is of an opinion contrary to that of a Pope, he ſpeaks thus; <hi>That the Pope hath ſaid it, as head of the Church, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg; but what he hath done, is, as to his judgment, within the ſphere of probability.</hi> You ſee then that this derogates nothing from the judgments of <hi>Popes,</hi> for if it did, it would not be ſuffered at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Diana</hi> is in ſo great reputation. For he does not affirme that what the Popes have decided is not probable, but, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their opinion within the ſphere of probability, he ſticks not to hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be alſo probable. This ſpeaks
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115411:68"/> abundance of reſpect in him, ſaid I. Nay it is more ſubtile, reply'd he, then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which Father <hi>Bauny</hi> made when they had cenſur'd his books at <hi>Rome.</hi> For he let fall this word againſt Monſieur <hi>Hallier,</hi> who perſecuted him tooth and naile; <hi>what community is there between the cenſure of</hi> Rome <hi>and that of</hi> France? Whence you may eaſily perceive, that, either by the interpretation of the termes, or by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the favourable circumſtances, or laſtly by the croſs-probability of the <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> we reconcile all theſe imaginary contradictions which you were ſtartled at before, without doing any violence to the deciſions of the Scripture, Councils, and Popes, as you plainly ſee. Well, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father, ſaid I, the <hi>Church</hi> is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy that you are her defenders. How advantagious are theſe probabilities? I knew not upon what ground you had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much pains to eſtabliſh, that one onely Doctor, <hi>if grave,</hi> may render an opinion probable, but that the contrary might be ſo too, and then a man may chuſe either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> as he thinks beſt, although he do not believe it certain, and all with ſo much ſafety of conſcience, that a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> who ſhould deny abſolution upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115411:68"/> the credit of theſe <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> were in the ſtate of damnation. Whence I apprehend that one particular <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> may, at his pleaſure, make new rules in Morality, and diſpoſe, according to his humour, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relates to the conduct of the Church. You muſt, ſaid the Father, admit ſome moderation in what you ſay. Obſerve well what I am going to tell you; it is our <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> wherein you will ſee the progreſs of an opinion, from its firſt beginnings to its maturity.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the <hi>grave</hi> Doctor who hath found it out, expoſes it to the world, and caſts it abroad as a ſeed to take root. While it is in this condition, it is weak, but time muſt ripen it by degrees. Upon which account, <hi>Diana,</hi> who hath introduc'd a many, ſayes in one place, <hi>I advance this opinion, but becauſe it is as yet new, I leave it to be ripen'd by time; relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo tempori maturandam.</hi> Accordingly in a few years it inſenſibly gathers ſtrength, and after a conſiderable time, it is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by the ſilent approbation of the Church, according to that excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of Father <hi>Bauny; That an opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanc'd by ſome Caſuiſts, if the Church oppoſe it not, it is an evident argument that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115411:69"/> ſhe approves it.</hi> And indeed by this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doth he confirm an opinion of his, in his ſixth Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 312. How, ſaid I, Father, by this account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Chu ch would be thought to approve all thoſe abuſes which ſhe ſuffers, and all thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinions in books which ſhe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures not? Diſpute it, ſaid he, with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bauny;</hi> I onely give you a relation, and you would debate the buſineſs with me. You muſt never diſpute matter of fact. I was telling you, that when time hath thus brought an opinion to maturity, then is it abſolutely <hi>porbable</hi> and <hi>ſure.</hi> And thence it comes, that the learned <hi>Caramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> in the Letter wherein he directs his <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Theologie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> to <hi>Diana,</hi> ſayes, that that great <hi>Diana, had rendred divers opinions probable which were not ſuch before, quae ante a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>non erant; &amp; conſequently that a man ſins no longer in following them, whereas before he did ſin, jam non peccant, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Truly Father, ſaid I, there is much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be got by your Doctors. Of two pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſons that do the ſame things, he who knows not their doctrine, ſins; he who does, ſins not. It is therefore at the ſame time both inſtructive and juſtificative. The law of God <hi>made men ſinners,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115411:69"/> of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> but this makes almoſt all innocent. I beſeech you, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inſtruct me fully as to this point, I will not leave you till you have acquainted me with the principal maximes which your Caſuiſts have eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Alas! ſaid the Father to me, it ſhould have been our principal end, not to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any other maximes then thoſe of the Goſpel in all their ſeverity. Nor is it leſſe evident from the regulation of our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that if we ſuffer any freedome in others, it is rather out of <hi>compliance</hi> then <hi>deſign;</hi> we are indeed forc'd to it. Men are now arriv'd to ſuch a height of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that we, not able to prevaile with them to come to us, are oblig'd to go over to them. Otherwiſe they would forſake us, they would do worſe, they would be abſolutely caſt away. It is therefore to reſtrain them that our <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the vices whereto men, in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conditions, are moſt inclin'd, that they might eſtabliſh maximes ſo gentle, (without injury to truth) as if they ſhould not be ſatisfied with, they muſt needs be very hard to pleaſe. For the main drift of our Society, for the advantage of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not to turn away any whatſoever,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115411:70"/> ſo to keep the world as much as may be together.</p>
               <p>We have therefore Maximes ſuitable to all ſorts of perſons, to ſuch as have <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> to diſpoſe to <hi>Priests,</hi> to <hi>Religious</hi> men, to <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to Menial <hi>Servants,</hi> to the <hi>Rich,</hi> to <hi>Merchants,</hi> to thoſe who are in <hi>troubles,</hi> to thoſe who are in <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> to devout <hi>women,</hi> to ſuch of that Sex as are not ſo, to <hi>married</hi> people, to ſuch as are <hi>diſordered.</hi> In a word, they have made proviſion for all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That is, ſaid I, you are furniſh'd for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Nobility</hi> and the <hi>Commons.</hi> I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſirous to know them.</p>
               <p>Let us begin, ſayes the Father, with the firſt. You know what trading there is at this day, about <hi>Benefices;</hi> and if we ſhould meaſure things by the writings of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and the <hi>Ancients,</hi> the Church would be found well ſtor'd with <hi>Simoniſts.</hi> Which conſidered, it is neceſſary our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould, by their prudence, moderate things, as theſe words of <hi>Valentia,</hi> one of <hi>Eſcobars</hi> four living creatures, will ſhew you. It is the concluſion of a long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe where he gives many expedients, among which the beſt in my judgment is this; in <hi>pag.</hi> 2042. of the third Tome.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115411:70"/> 
                  <hi>If a man give a temporal good for a ſpiritual,</hi> (that is to ſay, money for a Benefice) <hi>and that a man give money as the price of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifice, it is apparent Simony. But if he gives it as the motive inclining the will of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent to reſign his intereſt,</hi> non tanquam pretium beneficii, ſed tanquam motivum ad reſignandum, <hi>it is not Simony, though he that reſigns conſider, and look on the money as his principal end. Tannerus,</hi> who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of our Society affirmes the ſame thing, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 1519. confeſſing withal, <hi>that Saint</hi> Thomas <hi>is of a contrary opinion, in that he abſolutely maintains that it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Simony to give a spiritual good for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, if the temporal be the end thereof:</hi> By this means we do ſalve abundance of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For who would be ſo wicked, as, when he gives money for a benefice, to refuſe to do it out of an inclination to give it as a <hi>motive</hi> obliging the incumbent to reſign, inſtead of giving it as <hi>the price</hi> of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? No man is ſo far forſaken of God. I agree with you, ſaid I, that all the world have <hi>graces ſufficient,</hi> to make ſuch a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. It is very certain, reply'd the Father.</p>
               <p>You ſee then how we have mitigated things in regard of perſons that take bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. As for the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> we have diverſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115411:71"/> Maximes that are no leſſe favourable to them. For inſtance, take this of our twenty four, <hi>pag.</hi> 143. <hi>A Prieſt that hath once receiv'd money to ſay Maſs, may he take other money upon the account of the ſame maſs?</hi> Filliutius <hi>affirmes he may, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that part of the ſacrifice which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>longs to himſelf as Prieſt, to him who paies him laſt, provided he receive not as much as a whole maſs amounts to, but onely for one part, as haply for a third of the maſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Father, is certainly one of thoſe caſes wherein the <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For what you affirme muſt needs be ſo, after the authority of <hi>Filliutius</hi> and <hi>Eſcobar.</hi> But leaving it in <hi>the sphere of probability,</hi> the contrary, methinks, might very well be maintain'd, and made good by theſe reaſons. When the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Prieſts that are poor to receive money for their Maſſes, it being juſt that thoſe who ſerve the Altar ſhould live of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; her meaning is, not that they ſhould make an exchange of the ſacrifice for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, much leſs, that they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all thoſe graces which they ſhould firſt derive thence themſelves. Nay, I might further urge, <hi>that the Prieſts,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint <hi>Paul, are oblig'd to offer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115411:71"/> ſacrifice firſt for themſelves, and then for the people;</hi> that is, it is lawful for them to communicate to others the fruit of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but not voluntarily to exempt themſelves of all advantage thereof, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it on another for the third part of the Maſs, that is, four or five pence. Truly, Father, as little <hi>gravity</hi> as I pretend to, I could render this opinion probable. It would coſt you no great pains, ſaid he. That is apparently ſuch already. All the difficulty were to find out probability in the contrary. And that's the work of the moſt eminent, among whom Father <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is highly conſiderable. 'Tis infinitely pleaſant to ſee this able Caſuiſt diving into the <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> of the ſame Queſtion, wherein the Prieſts are ſtill concern'd, and faſt ning on reaſon every way, he is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and ingenious. He ſayes in a certain place, 'tis in his tenth Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 474. <hi>There cannot any ſuch Law be made, as ſhall oblige a benefic'd Prieſt to ſay Maſs every day, becauſe ſuch a law would infallibly,</hi> haud dub è, <hi>expoſe them to the danger of ſaying it ſometimes in mortal ſin. And yet in the ſame Treatiſe</hi> 10. pag. 441. he ſayes, <hi>That the Prieſts who have receiv'd money to ſay Maſs every day, ought to ſay it every
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115411:72"/> day, and that they cannot be diſpenſ'd with, upon pretence that they are not alwayes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently well prepared for to ſay it, becauſe it is in their power, at any time, to make an act of contrition, which if they neglect to do, it is their own fault, and not his upon whoſe account they are to ſay Maſs.</hi> And to take away the greateſt difficulties which might divert them from doing it, he thus reſolves the queſtion in the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>Qu.</hi> 32. <hi>pag.</hi> 457. <hi>May a Prieſt ſay Maſs the ſame day wherein he hath committed a mortal ſin, haply one of the moſt enormous, he making his confeſſion before-hand?</hi> Villalobos <hi>ſayes, not, becauſe of his uncleanneſs. But</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chez <hi>affirmes, he may, and that without ſin; and I think his opinion ſafe, and that it ought to be follow'd in practice; &amp; tuta, &amp; ſequenda in praxi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How Father, ſaid I, may this opinion be put into practice? May a Prieſt guilty of ſuch a diſorder, preſume, the ſame day, to approch the Altar upon Father <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s word? Or ſhould he not rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the ancient laws of the <hi>Church,</hi> which abſolutely excluded, from the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, thoſe Prieſts who had committed ſins of that nature, then the new opinions of <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> who readmit them thereto,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115411:72"/> on the very day that they are ſo fallen? You have a very treacherous memory, ſayes the Father, have I not ſometime told you, <hi>That in matters of Morality we are not to be guided by the ancient Fathers, but the modern Caſuiſts?</hi> as our Fathers, <hi>Cellot,</hi> and <hi>Reginaldus</hi> affirme. I remember it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, anſwer'd I, but this is a buſineſs of greater conſequence, for the Laws of the Church are therein concern'd. You ſpeak reaſon, ſaid he, but, it ſeems, you are not yet acquainted with this excellent maxime of our Fathers, <hi>That the Laws of the Church are of no force when they are no longer obſerv'd, cùm jam deſuetudìne abie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> as <hi>Filliutius</hi> affirmes, <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Tr.</hi> 25. <hi>N.</hi> 33. We ſee, better then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, the preſent exigences of the Church. If there were ſo much rigour obſerv'd in excluding Prieſts from the Altar, you eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend the conſequence, that there would not be ſo great a number of Maſſes. Now the abundance of Maſſes brings ſo much glory to God and ſo much profit to ſouls, that I dare affirme, with our Father <hi>Cellot,</hi> in his book of <hi>The Hierarchy,</hi> pag. 611. of the <hi>Roüen</hi> impreſſion, that there could not be too many Prieſts, <hi>though not onely all men and women, were it poſſible,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115411:73"/> but even all inanimate bodies, and brute beaſts,</hi> bruta animalia, <hi>were turn'd Prieſts to celebrate the Maſſe.</hi> I was ſo ſurpriz'd at that fantaſtick imagination, that I could not ſay any thing, ſo that he kept on his diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But there's enough as to the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> I ſhould be too tedious elſe, we come now to the <hi>Religious.</hi> The greateſt difficulties they meet with conſiſt in the obedience they owe their ſuperiours, ſee what gentle pills our Fathers preſcribe them. <hi>Caſtrus Palaus,</hi> of our Society, <hi>op. mor. pag.</hi> 1. <hi>diſp.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 6. ſayes; <hi>It is out of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> (non eſt controverſia) <hi>that the Religious man, who of his ſide hath a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, is not bound to obey his Superiour, though the Superiours opinion be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For in ſuch a caſe, it is lawful for the religious man to embrace that which is moſt acceptable to him,</hi> quae ſibi gratior fuerit, <hi>as</hi> Sanchez <hi>affirmes. Nay though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Superiour be juſt, you are not thereby engag'd to obey him, for it is not juſt as to all points, and in all circumſtances;</hi> non undequaque juſtè praecipit, <hi>but onely probably, and ſo you are probably engag'd to obey him, &amp; you are probably diſengag'd from obeying him,</hi> probabiliter obligatus, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babiliter
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115411:73"/> deobligatus.

               <p>We have conſidered, as to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the trouble they are in, when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciencious people, they ſerve diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Maſters, For if they do not all the meſſages they employ them in, they loſe their ſervices and fortunes; and if they obey them, they are troubled in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To comfort them in this condition, our twenty four <hi>Fathers,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 77. have exemplified the ſervices which they may perform with ſafety of Conſcience; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of theſe are ſome. <hi>To deliver Letters and Preſents; to open doors and windows; to help their Maſter to get in at a window; to hold the ladder while he gets up; all this is allowable and indifferent. But indeed to hold the ladder, it is requiſite they be threatned more then ordinary, in caſe they do not. For it is an injury to the Maſter of the houſe, for any man to come into it through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you obſerve how judiciouſly this proviſion is made? I expected no leſs, ſaid I, from a book extracted out of the works of twenty four <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> But our Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> added the Father, hath further taught ſervants to do their Maſters all theſe ſervices innocently, by obliging them to <hi>direct</hi> their <hi>intention,</hi> not to the ſins
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115411:74"/> wherein they are agents, but onely to their own profit thereby. This he hath handſomly expreſſed in his <hi>Summary of ſins, p.</hi> 710. of the <hi>firſt</hi> edition. <hi>Let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>take good notice, that they may not abſolve ſervants who do diſhonest M ſſages, if they conſent to the ſins of their Maſters; but we muſt ſay the contrary, if they do them for their own temporal advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> And this is eaſie for them to do, for why ſhould they be ſo ready to give their conſent to ſins, which onely put them to a great deal of trouble both of body and conſcience?</p>
               <p>Beſides, the ſame Father <hi>Bauny</hi> hath eſtabliſh'd this great Maxime, to oblige thoſe that are not content with their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

               <p>This Father, ſaid I, is juſt the caſe of <hi>John d' Alba.</hi> What <hi>John d' Alba,</hi> ſayes the Father, what do you mean? How, Father, have you forgot what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1647. where were you then? I read, ſayes he, Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at a College of ours, far from <hi>Paris.</hi> Then Father, ſaid I, I perceive you know not this ſtory, and therefore muſt needs tell it you. I heard it in a place where I was the other day from a perſon of good quality. He told us that this <hi>John d' Alba,</hi> being a ſervant to your Fathers of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of <hi>Cle mont</hi> in Saint <hi>James</hi> ſtreet, and thinking his wages too low, ſtole ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them to make it up.

But his judgment was, that that over-faithful diſciple ſhould be whipp'd before the College-gate of Clermont by the common Hangman, who at the ſame time ſhould bu n all the writings of thoſe Fathers treating</hi> of theft <hi>&amp; that they ſhould be prohibited to teach any ſuch doctrine again, upon pain of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men expected the effect of this general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approv'd judgment, where happens an accident which cauſed an arreſt of it. But in the mean time, the priſoner vaniſhes, (none knows how) and with him all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the buſineſs, ſo that <hi>John d' Alba</hi> got out, and made no reſtitution of the plates. This was his relation, to which he added that this judgment of Monſieur

                  <hi>De Montrouge</hi> is upon record in the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelet,</hi> where any one may ſee it. The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we thought very pleaſant.</p>
               <p>What do you take all this pains for, ſayes the Father? what does all this ſignifie? I entertain you with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of our Caſuiſts, and was juſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon thoſe that regard <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and you interrupt me with impertinent ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

This reply'd I, that you have ſecur'd all thoſe who follow your opinions in reſpect of <hi>God</hi> and their own <hi>Conſciences;</hi> for, as you affirme, a man is ſafe enough ſo far, by adhering to <hi>one grave</hi> Doctor. You have alſo given them good ſecurity, as to what concerns their <hi>Confeſſors;</hi> for you have oblig'd the Prieſts to abſolve them, upon a <hi>probable</hi> opinion, upon pain of <hi>mortal</hi> ſin. But you have not put them into a ſafe poſture in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Judges,</hi> inſomuch, that while

You are in the right, ſayes the Father, you oblige me very much. But the reaſon of it is, that we have not ſo much power over the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> as over the <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> who are oblig'd to ſubmit to us in all caſes of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> for we are the ſoveraign <hi>Judges</hi> there. That I underſtand very well, ſaid I, but if, on the one ſide, you are <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> are you not, on the other, <hi>Confeſſors</hi> to the <hi>Judges?</hi> your power is of a large extent: oblige them to acquit <hi>Criminals</hi> who go upon a <hi>probable opinion,</hi> upon pain of excluſion from the Sacraments; leſt it happen, to the great contempt and ſcandal of <hi>probability,</hi> that thoſe, whom you make innocent in the <hi>Theory,</hi> be <hi>whipt</hi> and <hi>hang'd</hi> in the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick.</hi> If you do not this, how can you expect Diſciples?

               <p>You know, ſaid he, that the paſſion which is moſt predominant in perſons of this rank, is, that punctilio of <hi>Honour,</hi> which ever and anon engages them to do thoſe violences that ſeem to be contrary to Chriſtian piety, which indeed are ſuch, that there were no way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to exclude them from <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our Fathers had not remitted ſomewhat of the ſeverity of Religion, the better to comply with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty. But, their duty towarde God obliging them to a ſubmiſſion to the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115411:78"/> Goſpel, and their charity towards their neighbour to an indulgence to the world, they had need of all their abilities to find out expedients, ſuch as ſhould moderate things with ſo much equality, that men might maintain and repaire their honour, by the wayes ordinarily uſed in the world, yet without burthening the Conſcience, ſo to make a certain proviſion for two things which ſeem to be ſo much oppoſite, as <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the deſign be advantageous, the execution of it is proportionably trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; nor do I doubt but you are ſenſible of the greatneſs and difficulty of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. It ſtartles me, ſaid I. It ſtartles you, reply'd he? I believe it. It would ſtartle othergates people then you are. Do you not know, that on the one ſide it is provided by the Evangelical Law, <hi>not to return evil for evil, but to leave vengeance to God?</hi> And on the other, the Laws of the world forbid a man to ſuffer injuries, but admit him to endeavour his own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and that many times by the death of his enemies? Have you ever ſeen any thing that ſeems to be more contrary? And yet when I tell you that our Fathers have reconcil'd theſe things, you can make
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115411:78"/> no other anſwer, then that it ſtartles you. My expreſſion, ſaid I, was a little too ſcanty; For indeed I ſhould think it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible, if having ſeen ſo much of your Fathers as I have, I were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied they could eaſily do what is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to other men. Upon this ground it is that I conceive they may haply have found out ſome expedient, which I admire before I know it, and which I would entreat you to d ſcover to me.</p>
               <p>If that be your meaning, ſaid he, I am ready to ſerve you. Know then that this miraculous principle, is nothing elſe but our grand method of <hi>directing the intention,</hi> a thing of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in our <hi>Morality,</hi> that I durſt almoſt compare it with the Doctrine of <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> You have ſeen ſeveral ſlight touches of it in thoſe <hi>Maximes</hi> I have already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd you with. For when I explicated to you the manner how ſervants may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly do certain unhandſome meſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, did you not obſerve that all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was in the <hi>diverſion of the intention</hi> from the evil, whereof they are the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to direct it to the advantage accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves thereby? This is the meaning of <hi>directing the intention.</hi> And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115411:79"/> you have, in like manner, ſeen that thoſe who give money for <hi>Benefices</hi> were inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably <hi>Simoniſts,</hi> were it not for a like <hi>diverſion.</hi> But now I will diſplay this grand method in its full luſtre, upon the ſubject <hi>Murther,</hi> which it juſtifies upon a thouſand occaſions, that by ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you may judge what it is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. I already perceive, ſaid I, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral permiſſion to do any thing, nothing ſhall eſcape it. You alwayes jump out of one extremity into another, reply'd the Father, amend that fault. For, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, that we do not permit all things, know, for inſtance, that we never ſuffer a man ſhould have no other deſign in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then a formal intention to ſin; and that, if any one be ſo obdurate, as in an evil action to limit his deſire by the evil it ſelfe, we have no more to do with him; this is diabolical, and admits not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of age, ſex, or quality. But if a man be not ſunk into that wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we endeavour to put in practice our method of <hi>directing the intention,</hi> which conſiſts in a mans propoſing to himſelf, as the end of his actions; an allowable object. Not but that we, as far as lies in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, divert men from doing things fordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115411:79"/> but when we cannot hinder the <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we at leaſt purifie the <hi>intention,</hi> and ſo correct the viciouſneſs of the <hi>means,</hi> by the purity of the <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, you ſee, have our Fathers found out a means to permit the violences men ordinarily commit in maintaining their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For there's no more to be done, then to divert the intention from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>revenge,</hi> which is ſinful, to incline it to a deſire of maintaining ones <hi>honour,</hi> which, according to our Fathers, is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And thus they acquit themſelves of a l obligations both towards God and towards men. For they ſatisfie the world by <hi>permitting</hi> the actions, and ſatisfie the Goſpel by <hi>purifying</hi> the intentions. This is a thing the Ancients never knew; the world is engag'd for it onely to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Do you now underſtand the buſineſs? Very well, ſaid I. You allow men the groſs ſubſtance of things, and give God that ſpiritual motion of the intention, and by this equal diviſion, make an alliance between divine and humane Laws. But Father, to deal freely with you, I am a little diſtruſtful of your promiſes, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether your Authors affirme as much as you do. You do me wrong, ſaid
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115411:80"/> the Father, I advance nothing but what I prove, and that by ſo many paſſages, that their number, their authority, and their reaſons will fill you with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For to let you ſee the Harmony our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have made between the maximes of the <hi>Gospel</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>world,</hi> by the means of this <hi>direction of the intention;</hi> hear what our Father <hi>Reginaldus</hi> ſaith, <hi>in praxi, l.</hi> 21. <hi>n.</hi> 62. <hi>p.</hi> 260 <hi>It is forbidden, that private men ſhould revenge themſelves. For Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith</hi> Rom. 12. <hi>Render not unto any man evil for evil.</hi> And <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 28. <hi>He who will revenge himſelf will bring upon himſelf the vengeance of God, and his ſin ſhall not be forgotten Beſides what is ſaid in the Gospel concerning the forgiving of offences, as in the</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 18. <hi>Chapter of Saint</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. Certainly, Father, ſaid I, if, this premiſed, he ſay any thing but what is in the Scripture, it cannot be for want of knowing it. What's his concluſion, I pray? This, ſaid he, <hi>From all theſe things it is evident, that a man of courage may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately purſue another that hath hurt him, not indeed out of any intention to render evil for evil, but out of that of preſerving his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> Non ut malum pro malo reddat, ſed ut conſervet honorem.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:115411:80"/>
               <p>See you then how careful they are to forbid a man to have an intention to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der evil for evil, becauſe the Scripture condemns it. No, they never permit that. <hi>See Leſſius de Juſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>d.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 79. <hi>He who hath had a box o'th' ear given him may not have the intention to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but he may be permitted that of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infamy, and to that end, may immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put back the injury, and that with his ſword,</hi> etiam cum gladio. We are ſo far from admitting that men ſhould entertain any deſign to be reveng'd of their enemies, that our Fathers will not ſo much as allow them to wiſh their death, out of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>hatred.</hi> See our Father <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> tr. 5.

And his action ſhall be in it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. For what hurt can there be for a man to go into a field, to walke there in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of another, and to defend himſelf if any one ſet upon him? So that he commits not any ſin at all, for when the intention is directed to other circumſtances, the chall nge is not at all accepted, for the acceptation of a challenge conſiſts in the expreſs intention of fighting, which ſuch a man hath not.</hi>

Petrus Hurtado</hi> affirmes the ſame thing, as he is cited by our famous <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> tr. 1. ex. 7. n. 96. and n. 98. where he adds theſe words of <hi>Hurtado, That a man may fight a duell even to defend his eſtate, if there be no other means to preſerve it, becauſe every man hath a right to ſecure what is his own, and that even by the death of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>

               <p>Theſe paſſages gave me occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115411:82"/> the difference there is between the piety of the <hi>King</hi> and that of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> the former uſing all his power to prohibit and aboliſh Duelling in his Dominions, the latter employing all their ſubtilty to make it allowable, and to countenance it in the Church. But the Father was in ſuch an excellent good humour, that it would have been unhandſome to interrupt him, ſo that he proceeded thus. In a word, ſayes he, <hi>Sanchez,</hi> (pray conſider what perſons I cite) goes further; for he allows a man not onely to accept, but alſo to give a challenge, if ſo be the <hi>direction of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be right.</hi> And our <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſeconds him in the place before-mentioned, <hi>n.</hi> 97. Father, ſaid I, if it be ſo, I am convinc'd, but I ſhall not believe he writ any ſuch thing till I ſee it. Then read it your ſelf, ſaid he; whereupon I read words to this effect in <hi>Sanchez</hi>'s <hi>Moral Theologie,</hi> l. 2. c. 39. n. 7. <q>It is but rational to affirme, that a man may fight a duell to ſave his life, his reputation, nay his eſtate, if it be any thing conſiderable, when it is cleare that others endeavour to take them away from him unjuſtly by foule practiſe and vexatious ſuits at Law, and that there is no other way to preſerve
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115411:83"/> them. And <hi>Nava rus</hi> ſayes very well, that in ſuch an occaſion it is lawfull either to accept or give the challenge, <hi>licet accep tare eſt offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by that means he ſhall not onely avoid the hazard he may be in, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his life in fighting, but alſo not participate of the ſin which his enemy would commit by the duell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Father, ſaid I, is a pious <hi>Treachery;</hi> but, how pious ſoever, it is ſtill a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, ſince a man is permitted to kill his enemy <hi>treacherouſty.</hi> Did I ſay, reply'd the Father, that one man might kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>treacherouſly?</hi> God forbid: I told you, he might do it <hi>ſecretly,</hi> and thence you conclude that it may be done <hi>treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,</hi> as if it were but one and the ſame thing. Learn of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> tr. 6. exa. 4. n. 26. what it is to kill <hi>treacherouſly,</hi> and then you will ſay ſomething. <hi>A man is ſaid to kill treacherouſly, when he kils him who hath not the leaſt ſuſpicion that ſuch a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115411:83"/> thing will happen to kim. He therefore that kills his enemy is not ſaid to kill treacherouſly, though he do it behind his back or by way of ambuſh,</hi> licèt per inſidias, aut à tergo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutiat. And in the ſame treatiſe, <hi>n.</hi> 56. <hi>He who kills his enemy with whom he had been reconcil'd, though under promiſe never to attempt his life again, is not abſolutely ſaid to k ll him treacherouſly, unleſs there had been a very intimate friendſhip between them before;</hi> arctior amicitia.</p>
               <p>You are now ſenſible that you do not ſo much as underſtand the termes, and yet will needs ſpeak as confidently as a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. I muſt indeed confeſs, ſaid I, that this is new to me, and I learn from this definition, that, haply, there never was any man kill'd <hi>treacherouſly;</hi> for a man ſeldome aſſaſſinates any but his enemies. But, however it be, a man according to <hi>Sanchez,</hi> (I do not ſay, <hi>treacherouſly,</hi> but behind the back or in an ambuſh) may confidently kill an <hi>Informer</hi> that proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes us in any Court, may he not? No doubt but he may, ſayes the Father, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there be a right <hi>direction of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> you ever forget what is moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. It is alſo the opinion of <hi>Molina, to.</hi> 4. <hi>tr.</hi> 3. <hi>disp.</hi> 12. nay, according to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115411:84"/> our learned <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> l. 21. c. 5. n. 57. <hi>a man may kill the falſe witneſſes which ſuch a proſecutor produceth againſt him.</hi> In a word, if we credit our eminent and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Fathers, <hi>Tamerus</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Sa;</hi> a man may kill both the falſe witneſſes and the Judge too, if there be any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between them. Take his own words, <hi>tr.</hi> 3. <hi>diſp.</hi> 4. <hi>q.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 83. <hi>Sotus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and</hi> Leſſius <hi>affirme that it is not lawful for a man to kill the falſe witneſſes, and the Judge which conſpire the death of an innocent perſon; but</hi> Emanuel Sa <hi>and other authors do, with reaſon, impugn that opinion, ſo far at leaſt, as it relates to matter of Conſcience.</hi> And he further maintaines, in the ſame place, that a man may kill both witneſſes and Judge.</p>
               <p>I am now Father, ſaid I, ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in your principle of the <hi>direction of the intention,</hi> but I would fain underſtand alſo the conſequences of it, and be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all thoſe caſes wherein this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod armes a man with a power to kill. Let us therefore run over thoſe you have put already, for fear of miſtake; for equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation were here very dangerous. I take it then upon your ſecurity, that there being a right direction of the intention, a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115411:84"/> man, to preſerve his reputation, or his eſtate, may, according to your Fathers, accept a challenge, ſometimes give one, he may ſecretly kill an unjuſt proſecutor, and with him the witneſſes he ſhould make uſe of, nay the corrupt Judge that favours them; you have further told me, that he who hath receiv'd a box o'th' ear, may, abſtracting all thoughts of <hi>revenge,</hi> right himſelf with his <hi>ſword.</hi> But, Father, you have not aſſign'd a proportion how far this may be done. A man cannot be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in that, reply'd the Father, for a man may proceed ſo far as to kill him. 'Tis excellently well prov'd by our learned <hi>Henriquez,</hi> l. 14. c. 10. n. 3. and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of our Fathers, cited by <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> tr. 1. ex. 7. n. 48. in theſe words. <hi>One man may kill another who hath given him a box o'th' ear, though he run away for it, provided he do it not out of hatred or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and that by that means there be a gap opened for exceſſive murthers, ſuch as are deſtructive to the ſtate. And the reaſon of it is, that a man may as well do that in purſuance of his reputation, as of his goods, taken away from him. For though your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be not ſo in the poſſeſſion of your enemy as would be the goods he had taken away from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115411:85"/> you, yet may it be recovered in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beſides that it is a certain expreſſion of height of spirit, and authority, and that a man gaines eſteeme among men for doing it. And indeed is it not confeſs'd that he who hath ſo receiv'd a box o'th' ear, is accounted diſhonourable, till ſuch time as he hath kill'd his enemy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I thought a tenent ſo horrid, that I had much ado to keep my ſelf in; but, out of a deſire to know that follow'd, I let him go on. Nay, ſaid he, a man may, to prevent a box o'th' ear, kill him that is going to give it, if there be no other way to avoid it. This is obvious in our Fathers. For inſtance, <hi>Azor. inſt. mor. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 105. (he is one of the 24. Ancients) puts this caſe. <q>Is it lawful for a perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to kill one that would give him a box o'th' ear, or a bang with a ſtick? Some ſay, not, and their reaſon is, that the life of our neighbour is more precious then our honour, beſides the barbariſme it were to kill a man out of no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive then that of avoiding a blow. But others affirme it lawful; and for my part, I think it probable, when it cannot be avoided otherwiſe. For if it were not, the reputation of innocent perſons
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115411:85"/> were perpetually expoſ'd to the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the malicious.</q> This is further maintained by our great <hi>Filiutius,</hi> to. 2. tr. 29. c. 3. n. 50. by Father <hi>Hereau</hi> in his writings concerning murther; <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza, to.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 170. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. § 137. and <hi>Becanus,</hi> Somm. t. 1. q 64. <hi>de homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid.</hi> Add to theſe our Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, it is ſo generally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that <hi>Leſſius,</hi> l. 2. c. 9. d. 12. n. 77. ſpeaks of it as a tenent made abſolutely <hi>ſterling,</hi> by the unanimous conſent of all <hi>Caſuiſts.

               <p>I gave him thanks, for indeed I had heard but too much. Yet to ſee how far he would ſtretch this pernicious doctrine. But Father, ſaid I to him, may it not be lawful for one man to kill another for

For <hi>Leſſius</hi> whom Father <hi>Hereau</hi> among others follows word for word, ſayes in the place before cited. <q>If you endeavour to ruine my reputation by opprobrious ſpeeches ſpoken before perſons of honour, and that I cannot avoid them otherwiſe then by killing you, may I do it? According to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors I may, nay though the crime you lay to my charge, be ſuch as I am really guilty of, it being ſuppoſ'd to have been ſo ſecretly committed that you cannot diſcover it according to the wayes of juſtice. 'Tis thus prov'd. If when you would take away my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by giving me a box o'th' ear, it is in my power to prevent it by force of armes, the ſame defence is certainly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when you would do me the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115411:86"/> with your tongue. Beſides, a man may avoid the affronts of thoſe whoſe ill language he cannot hinder. In a word, Honour is more precious then Life; but a man may kill in defence of his life, <hi>ergo,</hi> he may alſo kill in defence of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</q> There's Arguments in forme for you; this is not <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> but <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> To conclude, this great <hi>Leſſius</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>n.</hi> 78. ſhews that one man may kill another for a ſimple <hi>gesture,</hi> or expreſſion of contempt. <hi>There are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſeveral wayes to derogate from, and to take away a mans reputation, wherein yet it is but juſt a man ſhould right himſelf; as by giving a man a bang with a ſtick, or a box o'th' ear, or if a man ſhould affront us by words or by ſigns;</hi> ſive per ſigna.</p>
               <p>O Father, ſaid I, you have ſaid as much as need be wiſh'd for the ſecurity of a mans honour, but certainly their lives muſt run many a hazard, if for ill language and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging geſtures, a man may kill at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that with a ſafe conſcience. All this is true, ſaid he, but our Fathers out of their extraordinary circumſpection, have thought it convenient this doctrine ſhould not be put in practice in certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Judges, ſayes the Father, who dive not into mens Conſciences, proceed onely according to the <hi>external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of an action, whereas we princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conſider the <hi>extention.</hi> Thence comes it to paſs, that our maximes are ſometimes different from theirs. However it be, Father, ſaid I, it is eaſily concluded from you, that a man may, with ſafety of Conſcience, kill ſuch as are <hi>evil ſpeakers,</hi> provided he mind the ſafety of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>But Father, ſince you have made ſuch excellent proviſion for a mans <hi>honour,</hi> have you made none for his <hi>eſtate?</hi> I know it is of leſs importance, but it matters not. Methinks a man may very well direct his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115411:88"/> intention ſo as to kill another, to preſerve that. He may, ſayes the Father, and I have given you ſome hints whence you might infer as much.

Why do they not fix on a certain ſumme? How, ſayes the Father, do you think it ſo eaſie a matter to aſſign a ſumme of money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the life of a man, and a Chriſtian? Here it is that I have a fair oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew you the neceſſity there is of our <hi>Caſuiſts.</hi> Do you find out in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, for how much money it may be lawful to kill a man? What will

Our great and incomparable <hi>Molina,</hi> ſayes he, the glory of our <hi>Society,</hi> who by his inimitable prudence hath valued it <hi>at</hi> ſix <hi>or</hi> ſeven <hi>Duckets, for whi h he aſſures us that it is lawful to kill a man, though he who hath taken them flie for it.</hi> 'Tis in his <hi>to.</hi> 4. <hi>tr.</hi> 3. <hi>disp</hi> 16. <hi>d.</hi> 6. adding further in the ſame place, <hi>that he durſt not charge that man with any ſin who kills another who had taken from him a thing of the value of a Crown or leſs, unius aurei, vel minoris adhuc valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> Which gave <hi>Eſcobar</hi> occaſion to lay down this general Rule, <hi>n.</hi> 44. <hi>That regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it is lawful to kill a man for the value of a Crown, according to</hi> Molina.</p>
               <p>O Father, ſaid I, how came <hi>Molina</hi> to be ſo illuminated as to determine a thing of this importance without any aſſiſtance of either Scripture, Councils, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? I muſt needs conceive that he was led by a particular light, much different from that of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as well upon the ſubject of <hi>Homicide,</hi> as that of <hi>grace.</hi> I am perfectly illuminated thus far, and withall fully ſatisfied, that there are none but thoſe of the Clergie which a man may

Were it, in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, rational that thoſe whom of all the world we ought to reſpect the moſt, ſhould be the onely men expoſ'd to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies of the wicked?

               <p>It is alſo maintain'd by our eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Amicus,</hi> that it is lawful for Prieſts and Religious men to prevent thoſe that would diſgrace them by opprobrious ſpeeches, by killing them before-hand.

For the caſe being ſuch, as it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for that Religious man to kill him who would take away his life, it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawful for him to kill him who would take away his own honour, or that of the Community, whereof he is a member, with as much reaſon as there is for thoſe that are of the world to do the like.</q> This indeed I was ignorant of, ſaid I, and was ſimply perſwaded to the contrary without making any reflection thereon, minding onely what I heard ſaid that the Church is ſo far from having ought to do with bloud, that ſhe permits not Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Judges to be preſent at criminal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let not that breed any wormes in your Conſcience, ſayes he, our Father <hi>Amicus</hi> proves this doctrine fully, though out of an exceſs of humility well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a perſon, he ſubmits it to the prudent Reader. Add to this, that <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouël,</hi> our illuſtrious defender, citing it in his <hi>Fundamental Theologie,</hi> pag. 543. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it to be ſo certain that he maintains
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115411:90"/> the <hi>contrary not to be ſo much as probable;</hi> and he draws from it moſt admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, as among others this which he calls the <hi>Concluſion of Concluſions,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionum concluſio; <hi>That a Prieſt not onely may upon certain occaſions kill a Detractor, but that there are ſome wherein he is</hi> OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIG'D <hi>to do it, etiam aliquando d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe, ſayes he, they derogate nothing from our reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; take his own words, <hi>n.</hi> 1146. and 1147. <hi>p.</hi> 547, 548. <hi>The Janſeniſts call the Jeſuits Pelagians; may they be kill'd for ſo doing? Not: becauſe the Janſeniſts do no more darken the Luſtre of the Society then an Owle does that of the Sun: on the contrary, they have added thereto, though contrary to their intention.</hi> Occidi non poſſunt, quia nocere non potuerunt.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:115411:90"/>
               <p>Alas, Father ſaid I, do the lives of the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> depend meerly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the queſtion, whether they prejudice your reputation? I think them very inſecure, if it be ſo. For if it prove ever ſo weakly probable that they do injure you, they are in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be diſpatch'd without any difficulty. You will reduce it into an <hi>argument in forme;</hi> and there needs no more then that, with a little <hi>direction of the intention,</hi> to ſend a man out of this world, with ſafety of <hi>Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ience.</hi> O how happy were they, whoſe natures cannot brook injuries, to be inſtructed in this Doctrine! But what a ſad condition are they in that offend them! Certainly Father, a man might as ſafely deal with people that have <hi>no</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as thoſe who are train'd up according to this <hi>Dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ion.</hi> For to conclude, the intention of him who hurteth leſſens not the pain of him that is hurt. He perceives not that ſecret direction, and is onely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the blow he receives. Nay I ſee not but that a man may with leſs indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſee himſelf barbarouſly murther'd by perſons purpoſely ſet to do it, then feel the conſcientious ſtilletto's of people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to devotion.</p>
               <p>To be free with you, Father, I am a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115411:91"/> little ſtartled at this, and theſe queſtions of Father <hi>Amicus</hi> and <hi>Caramuel</hi> I cannot digeſt. Why ſayes the Father, are you a <hi>Janſeniſt?</hi> I have another reaſon for it, ſaid I, which is this, that I ever and anon write to a friend I have in the Countrey whatever I learn of the maximes of your Fathers. And though all my buſineſs be ſimply to relate and faithfully to cite their words, yet am I doubtful they ſhould come to the ſight of ſome unſetled mind, who muſt either imagjne you very much injur'd, or draw from your principles ſome abominable concluſion. Go, go, ſayes the Father, they are ſuch as will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cauſe you any hurt, I warrant you.

               <p>What I write therefore is upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the good Father, but my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fails me, and not paſſages; for there are ſo many others, and thoſe ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that it would require whole volumes to ſay all that might be ſaid.

               <p>To enter into the buſineſs, I will give you one of the moſt conſiderable and moſt advantagious Maximes which our Fathers ever taught in their favour. We have it from our learned <hi>Caſtro Palao,</hi> one of our twenty four Ancients.

For, to take away all ſcruples they might make to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any in ſome caſes, he hath been ſo liberal of his endeavours, as to give a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of all thoſe caſes wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly may receive them, unleſs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Father, ſaid I, I think never any but <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> made uſe of that word; is it to be found in any other books? How are you to ſeek in theſe things, ſayes the Father? The book laſt mentioned of <hi>Moral Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Printed this very year at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Mohatra,</hi> and that very learnedly. The ttile of it is <hi>Epilogus Summarum.</hi> It is an Epitome of all the Summes of Divinity taken out of our Fathers, <hi>Suarez, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chez, Leſſius, Fagundez, Hurtado,</hi> and other famous <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> as the title ſhews. You will find in the 54 page theſe words, <hi>The Mohatra is, when a man having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for</hi> 20. <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>buyes of a Mercer as many Stuffs as amount to</hi> 30. <abbr>l.</abbr>

                  <hi>ready money.</hi> Hence you may perceive that the <hi>Mohatra</hi> is not ſo ſtrange a word. Very well Father, ſaid I; but is this a lawful contract? <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> replies the Father, ſayes in the ſame place, that <hi>there are ſome Laws that forbid it under ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great penalties.</hi> Then it ſignifies nothing,

               <p>This charity, Father, is certainly very great, ſaid I, to reſcue one from robbing, by expoſing another to the mercy of the Thief. But I ſhould think that to make this piece of charity perfect, he, who had aſſign'd the rich man to be robbed ſhould be accordingly oblig'd in conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to him that which he had cauſ'd to be taken away from him.

'Tis in his <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,</hi> ch. 13. <hi>A certain man intreats a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to beat his neighbour, or to fire the barn of one that hath offended him; the question <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

My opinion is, he ought not: for no man is oblig'd to make reſtitution, if he hath not done that which is unjuſt. Does a man do that which is unjuſt when he onely entreats another to do him a courteſie? Whatever may be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, he is ſtill at liberty either to grant or deny it. Which way ſoever he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, whether to reſtore, or not, he is guided meerly by his own will. There's no obligation lies upon him but that of goodneſs, ſympathy, and the eaſineſs of his own nature.

               <p>You may, ſayes he, by ſo many proofs, eaſily perceive how frivolous your objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, and that they amount to nothing but to make us digreſs from the buſineſs we have in hand. Proceed we then to perſons that are <hi>in neceſſity,</hi> for whoſe comfort and encouragement our Fathers, and among others <hi>Leſſius,</hi> l. 2. c. 12. n. 29. affirme, <hi>that it is lawful to ſteal, not onely in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity, but alſo in ſuch a neceſſity as is hard to be endur'd, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. Eſcobar</hi> cites him, <hi>tr.</hi> 1. <hi>ex.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 29. This is very ſtrange, Father, ſaid I; there are few in the world who think not their neceſſity <hi>hard to be endur'd,</hi> whom yet you would not allow the liberty to ſteal with a ſafe Conſcience. Nay though you ſhould limit this permiſſion to thoſe onely who really are in that condition, yet
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115411:99"/> muſt you needs open a gap for abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thefts, which the Magiſtrate would puniſh notwithſtanding that, ſo <hi>hard to be endur'd,</hi> neceſſity; whereas you ſhould rather endeavour to ſuppreſs them, ſince it is your duty to promote not onely juſtice among men, but alſo charity, which by this principle is clearly deſtroy'd. For is it not an open violation of charity, and an injury to ones neighbour, for a man to deprive him of what is his, and convert it to his own uſe and advantage? This is the doctrine I have been hitherto brought up in. It does not hold alwayes true, replies the Father, for our great <hi>Molina</hi> hath taught us, <hi>t.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 328. <hi>n.</hi> 8. <hi>That the order of charity doth not require that a man ſhould deprive himſelf of an advantage to ſave his neighbour from a prejudice propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable thereto.</hi> This he ſayes to make good what he had undertaken to prove in that place, viz. <hi>that a man is not oblig'd in conſcience to reſtore the goods which another had depoſited in his hands purpoſely to defraud his Creditors.</hi> And <hi>Leſſius</hi> maintaining the ſame opinion, confirmes it by the ſame principles, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c</hi> 20. <hi>d,</hi> 19. <hi>n.</hi> 168.</p>
               <p>You haply have little compaſſion for ſuch as are put to their ſh fts, but our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115411:99"/> have been more tender then ſo. They do juſtice as well to the poor as the rich; nay they do it ever to <hi>ſinners.</hi> For though they are infinitely at a diſtance with thoſe that commit crimes, yet are they ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table towards them, as to teach, that goods purchaſed by crimes may lawfully be retained. <hi>Leſsius</hi> affirmes it, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. d. 6 n. 46. <hi>certain it is that goods gotten by Adultery are purchaſed by an unlawful way; yet is the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know not, ſayes the Father, what law-books may ſay as to this point, but am certain, that ours, which are the infallible rules of Conſciences, ſpeak as I do. 'Tis true they except one caſe, wherein they oblige to make reſtitution; <hi>viz.</hi> when a man hath received money of thoſe who are not in a capacity to diſpoſe of what they have, ſuch as are <hi>perſons</hi> under age, and <hi>Religious</hi> men. For theſe are by our great <hi>Molina,</hi> excepted in <hi>t.</hi> 1. <hi>de Juſt. tr.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 94. <hi>niſi mulier accepiſſet ab eo qui alienare non poteſt; ut à religioſo, &amp; filio familias.</hi> In this caſe their money is to be reſtored. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> cites this paſſage in <hi>tr.</hi> 1. <hi>ex.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 59. and confirmes the ſame thing <hi>tr.</hi> 3. <hi>ex.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>But under your fatherly correction, ſaid I, methinks you are more tender of Religious men in this caſe then others.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115411:100"/> Not at all, ſayes the Father, is there not the ſame care had for all generally under-age, of which number Religious men are while they live? There's much reaſon they ſhould be excepted. But for what concerns all others, there's no obligation to return them what they have given for the doing of an evil action. <hi>Leſsius</hi> proves it at large, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>de juſt. c.</hi> 14. <hi>d.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 52. <hi>What a man receives,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>for any criminal action, is not ſubject to reſtitution by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural juſtice, becauſe a wicked action may be ſet at a certain value, out of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the advantage which he receives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by who was the occaſion of the doing of it; as alſo of the paines which he takes who puts it in execution. For this reaſon a man does not lie under any obligation to return what he hath receiv'd for performing it, be the action of what nature it will, as murther, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ſentences, incontinence, unleſs it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of ſuch as are incapable of diſpoſing of what they have. You will haply ſay, that he who receives money for doing a miſchief or an ill-turn, commits a ſin, and conſequently that he can neither receive nor retain it: but I anſwer, that when the blow is once given and the buſineſs done, there is then no ſin at all either to pay or receive the payment.</hi> Our
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115411:101"/> great <hi>Filiutius</hi> minces this buſineſs yet a little ſmaller; for he further preſſes, <hi>that a man is oblig'd in conſcience to make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſatisfactions for good turnes on actions of this kind, according to the different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of thoſe that commit them, and that ſome are to be better conſidered then others.</hi> And that it is he eſtabliſhes upon ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in <hi>tr.</hi> 31. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 231. <hi>Occultae for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicariae debetur pretium in conſcientiâ, &amp; multò majore ratione quàm publicae. Copia enim quam occulta facit mulier ſui corporis, multò plus valet quam ea quam publica fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit meretrix: nec ulla eſt lex poſitiva quae reddat eam incapacem pretii. Idem dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum de pretio promiſſo Virgini, conjugatae, Moniali, &amp; cuicunque alii. Eſt enim om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium eadem ratio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſecond which paſſage he turn'd over his Authors, and ſhew'd me ſome things of this nature ſo horrid and infamous that I durſt not repeat them, and ſuch as he would have been ſtartled at himſelf (for he is a good honeſt man) were it not for the implicite reſpect he hath to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which makes him look on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes from them with a certain ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. I in the mean time was ſilent, not ſo much out of any deſign to engage him
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115411:101"/> in the purſuance of that ſubject, as out of amazement to ſee the books of Religious men fraught with deciſions ſo horrid, ſo unjuſt, and withall ſo extravagant. He therefore went freely on with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whereof the concluſion was this. For this reaſon is it, ſayes he, that our illuſtrious <hi>Molina,</hi> (I ſuppoſe after him you will look for no further ſatisfaction) decides this queſtion thus. <hi>When a man hath receiv'd mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We muſt diſtinguiſh,</hi> ſayes this excellent man; <hi>if he have not done the action for the doing of which he had before hand been paid, he ought to return the money; but if he hath done it, he is not oblig'd to any reſtitut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on: ſi non fecit hoc malum tenetur reſtituere, ſecùs, ſi fecit.</hi> This paſſage is cited by <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> tr. 3 ex. 2. n. 138.</p>
               <p>Thus have you heard ſome of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples concerning <hi>Reſtitution.</hi> I have kept you very hard at it to day; I would now ſee how you profit under theſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Anſwer me then. <hi>Is a Judge who hath receiv'd a bribe from one of the parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to give ſentence on his ſide, oblig'd to return it?</hi> You juſt now told me, ſaid I, that he was not. I thought as much; did I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115411:102"/> it generally? I onely told you that he was not oblig'd to reſtore, if by his means the cauſe went of his ſide who had no right. But when a man hath right on his ſide, would you have him further purchaſe the carrying on of his cauſe, which is but his due in juſtice? There's no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for that. Do you not apprehend that juſtice is a <hi>debt</hi> due from the Judge, and that conſequently he cannot <hi>ſell</hi> it; but that unjuſtice is not any way due from him, and that conſequently he may receive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for it. This doctrine is generally and unanimouſly taught by all our principal Authors, as, <hi>Molina</hi> diſp. 94. and 99. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginaldus,</hi> l. 10. n. 184, 185. and 178. <hi>Filiutius,</hi> tr. 31. n. 220. and 228. <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> tr. 3. ex. 1. n. 21. and 23. <hi>Leſſius,</hi> l. 2. c. 14. d. 8. n 52. <hi>That a Judge may well be oblig'd to return what he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by way of bribe for to do juſtice, unleſs it be beſtow'd on him out of Liberality; but that he is never oblig'd to return what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of a man, in whoſe favour he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an unjuſt ſentence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fantaſtical deciſion put me a little out of my bias; but while I reflected on the pernicious conſequences of it, the Father had provided another queſtion for me.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115411:102"/> Anſwer now, ſaid he, with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection then before. I ask you, whether a man who pretends to Fortune-telling, be oblig'd to make reſtitution of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he hath gotten by that employment? What your Reverence pleaſes, Father, ſaid I. How, what I pleaſe, reply'd he? You are certainly an admirable Scholar! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your expreſſion, it ſhould ſeem that the truth depended on our will. But I ſee you could never have found out this of your ſelf. See then how <hi>Sanchez</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the difficulty; but note it is no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man then <hi>Sanchez.</hi> In the firſt place he diſtinguiſhes, in his <hi>Summary,</hi> l. 2. c. 38. n. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For he ſayes, he is oblig'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in one caſe, and not in the other.</hi> But in which do you think he is oblig'd? There's no great difficulty in that, ſaid I. I perceive, ſaid he, what you would ſay; you think he is oblig'd to reſtitution, in the caſe wherein he hath made uſe of ſome dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical aſſiſtance: But you are far from the buſineſs; it is but quite the contrary. See <hi>Sanchez</hi>'s reſolution in the ſame place. <hi>If this Fortune teller hath not been at the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115411:103"/> paines and trouble to find out by the help of the Devil, what he could not otherwiſe have attained the knowledg of;</hi> ſi nullam operam appoſuit, ut arte diaboli id ſciret, <hi>he ought to make reſtitution; but if he have taken that paines, he is not oblig'd to any at all.</hi> And how comes that Father, ſaid I? Do you not apprehend it, ſayes he? 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man may well foretell by ſome Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical art, whereas Aſtrologie is nothing but impoſture and deceit. But Father, ſaid I, put the caſe the Devil do not anſwer truly, for he is not much more to be credited then Aſtrologie, ſhall not the Fortune teller upon the ſame ground, be oblig'd to make reſtitution? Not alwayes, reply'd he. <hi>Diſtinguo,</hi> ſayes <hi>Sanchez</hi> to that point. <hi>For if the Fortune teller be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Diabolical Arts,</hi> ſi ſit artis diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae ignarus, <hi>he is oblig'd to make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bt if he be an experienced Conjurer, and hath done all that lay in his power to find out the truth, he is not oblig'd to any at all. For then the diligence of ſuch a Conjurer may well be thought worth a reweard, dilig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115411:103"/> their art, out of hopes of enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawfully, according to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, by proving faithful ſervants to the publick. You ſpeak methinks a little ſaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, ſayes the Father; 'tis not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. For if you ſpeak ſo freely, in ſome places where you are not known, there might haply be ſuch as would take your diſcourſes very much amiſs, and would charge you with making your ſelf a ſport of Religion. I ſhould eaſily avoid that reproch, ſaid I, for I am of opinion, that if men would take the paines to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the true meaning of my words, there will not be found any, whence the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may not clearly be deduc'd, and a day may haply come that our diſcourſe may miniſter ſome occaſion to make it appear. Ho, ho, ſayes the Father, you are it ſeems in very good earneſt? I muſt tell you, ſaid I, that to imagine I make ſport with holy things, is a jealouſie I ſhould as eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as it is in it ſelf unjuſt. I onely ſaid it in jeſt, reply'd the Father, but let's be more ſerious. I ſtand ready to do what you pleaſe Father, ſaid I, it depends alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on you. But I muſt confeſs I was a little ſurpriz'd to ſee that your Fathers have been ſo univerſally careful of perſons
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115411:104"/> of all ranks and qualities, that they would needs regulate the lawful advantages of Magicians. The world is wide, ſayes the Father, a man cannot write too much for it, nor be over-particular in putting caſes, nor repeat too often the ſame thing in ſeveral books. How true this is you will finde by this paſſage out of one of the greateſt of our Fathers. You may well allow him to be ſuch, when he is at this preſent, our Father <hi>Provincial.</hi> 'Tis R. F. <hi>Cellot</hi> in his eighth book of the <hi>Hierarch. c.</hi> 16 §. 2. <hi>We know,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>a certain perſon, who carried a conſiderable ſumme of mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I would gladly know ſome of the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, Father, ſaid I. They are all ſuch, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he; for inſtance. <hi>To ſalute the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin when ever you meet with any Image of hers; to ſay over ten Ave-Maries for the ten pleaſures of the Virgin; often to pronounce the name of</hi> Mary; <hi>to give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Angels to do her reverence as from us; to wiſh ones ſelf able to build her more churches, then all Kings and Princes have, put together; to bid her good morrow every morning, and good night every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to ſay every day on Ave-Mary in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the heart of</hi> Mary. Nay he affirmes this laſt Devotion to be ſo effectual, that the practiſer thereof may aſſure himſelf of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115411:107"/> the <hi>Virgin's heart.</hi> It may be Father, ſaid I, but certainly with this proviſo, that he preſent her with his? There's no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of that, ſaid he, ſpecially when a man is too much taken up with the things of this world; take his own words. <hi>Heart for heart, were indeed but what ought to be; but yours haply is too much taken up with the world, and is ever filled with the creature. For which reaſon I dare not invite you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to offer up that little ſlave which you call your heart.</hi> And ſo he is ſatisfied with the <hi>Ave-Mary</hi> he at firſt deſired. Theſe are the Devotions of <hi>pag.</hi> 33. 59. 145. 156. 172. 258. and 420. of the <hi>firſt</hi> Edition. This is an extraordinary convenience, ſaid I, ſuch, as I conceive, there will not any be damn'd hereafter. Alas, alas! ſayes the Father, I perceive you know not how far the hardneſs of heart of ſome people may extend! There are thoſe in the world, who would never be oblig'd to ſay every day theſe two words, <hi>good morrow, good night,</hi> as being a thing cannot be done without ſome application of the memory.

                  </gap>mity. 'Tis indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he, as much as poſſibly could be done, and I think will ſerve the turn. For that were a wretched Chriſtian indeed, who would not ſet aſide one moment in all his life to put a pair of Beads about his arme, or a Roſary in his pocket, and by that means ſecure his ſalvation. And that it ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly does, that thoſe who have made trial thereof, have never been diſappointed, after what manner ſoever they have liv'd, though we ſtill exhort people to good life. Of this I ſhall give you no other inſtance then what is in <hi>pag,</hi> 34. of a woman who practiſing daily the devotions of ſaluting the images of the Bleſſed Virgin, liv'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs all her life in mortal ſin; at laſt dyes in that condition, and yet was ſav'd by the merit of that devotion. How could that poſſibly be, cry'd I? thus, ſaid he, our Saviour raiſ'd her again for that very purpoſe. So certain is it that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115411:108"/> miſcarry if he practiſe any of theſe devotions.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs Father, ſaid I, that the <hi>Devotions</hi> done to the <hi>Virgin</hi> are a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full means, conducing much to ſalvation, and that the leaſt among them are of great merit when they are the effects of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> ſuch as they were in the Saints that practiſ'd them; but to think to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thoſe who uſe them without any change of their ill lives, that they ſhall be converted at the hour of death, or that God ſhall raiſe them againe, is a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in my judgment, fitter to encourage ſinners in their evil courſes, by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous peace which this raſh confidence brings with it, then to recall them by a true real converſion, which is the work of <hi>Grace</hi> onely. <hi>What matters it,</hi> ſayes the Father, <hi>how we get into Paradiſe, ſo we can but once get in,</hi> as upon ſome ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſayes the famous Father <hi>Binet,</hi> ſometime our Provincial, in his excellent book, <hi>Of the mark of Predeſtination,</hi> n. 31. p. 130. of the <hi>fifteenth</hi> Edition. <hi>By hook or by crook it matters it not whether, ſo we can but gain the city of glory;</hi> as the ſame Father ſayes in the ſame place. It matters not indeed I muſt confeſs, ſaid I, but the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115411:108"/> queſtion is, whether a man ſhall get in. The Virgin, ſaid he, is your <hi>ſecurity</hi> for that. You have it in the cloſe of Father <hi>Barry</hi>'s book. <hi>If it happen that at the hour of death, the enemy of mankind ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome intereſt in you, and that it might occaſion ſome diſturbance in the little Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of your reſolution, you have no more to ſay, then that</hi> Mary <hi>is responſible for you, and that it is to her that he muſt apply himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Father, ſaid I, if a man would preſs this further, you would be at a little loſs. For, in one word, who hath aſſured us that the Virgin will be reſponſible? Father <hi>Barry,</hi> ſayes he, is engag'd for her, <hi>pag.</hi> 465. <hi>As for the happineſs and advantage you ſhall receive thereby, I will be responſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, and paſs my word for that good Mother.</hi> But Father, ſaid I, who ſhall be engag'd for Father <hi>Barry?</hi> How, ſayes the Father? he is one of us, and are you yet to learn that our Society is reſponſible for all the books of our Fathers? This is a thing worthy your knowledge. There is then a certain order in our Society, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a prohibition to all Book-ſellers to print any work of our Fathers, without the approbation of the Divines of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,

                  </gap>road which proceeds not from the ſpirit of the Society. Thus much it was very fit you knew. I look on it Father, ſaid I, as a great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and all I am troubled at, is, that I knew it not ſooner. For this knowledge engages a man to be much more attentive to your Authors. I ſhould have done it before, ſaid he, had but the leaſt occaſion offered it ſelf, but make the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage you can of it for the future, and let us go on with our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I conceive, ſaid he, I have furniſh'd you with wayes how a man may ſecure his ſalvation ſufficient, as to eaſineſs, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and number; yet our Fathers wiſh men would not ſatisfie themſelves with this firſt degree, wherein a man does no more then what is preciſely neceſſary in order to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs. For as it is their main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115411:109"/> to promote as much as may be the glory of God, ſo do they think nothing contributes ſo much thereto as to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage man-kind to greater piety. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the children of this world are the more diverted from <hi>Devotion</hi> by the ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is made of it, our Fathers have thought it a thing of extraordinary conſequence, abſolutely to take away that fundamental obſtacle. This is it that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>le Moine</hi> hath got abundance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for in his book of EASIE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOTION, which he writ meerly to that purpoſe. There he gives us a moſt excellent repreſentation of <hi>Devotion,</hi> for indeed no man ever underſtood it ſo well as he did. You have it in the firſt words of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. <hi>Virtue never yet appear'd to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never was there any portraiture made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that was like her. It is not at all to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd that ſo few have endeavoured to climb up her rock. They have made her ſo ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as to affect nothing ſo much as ſolitude. They have appointed for her attendants, grief and labour; in a word, they have made her the greateſt enemy of divertiſement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, wherein conſiſt the onely comfort and enjoyment of humane life.</hi> This he ſays, <hi>page</hi> 92.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:115411:110"/>
               <p>But Father, ſaid I, this I am certain of, that there are very eminent Saints whoſe lives have been extremely auſtere. 'Tis very true, ſaid he, but there have been withall ſome <hi>Polite Saints,</hi> and <hi>Courtier-like Puritans,</hi> according to the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>pag.</hi> 191.

He would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over-preſſed with a heavy burden, ſhould he but take the leaſt enjoyment or recreation. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon Feſtival dayes, his converſation is among the dead. He is more in love with himſelf, when lodg'd within a tree, or in a grot, then if he were in a palace or upon a throne. For injuries and affronts, he is as inſenſible of them, as if his eyes and ears were no other then thoſe of a Statue. Honour and reputation are Idols he hath no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with, and which he hath nothing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to. A beautiful woman is a ghoſt to him; nay thoſe imperious and ſoveraign looks, thoſe inviting Tyrants, who, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With your Reverences favour, ſaid I, I muſt needs ſay, that had you not told me that Father <hi>le Moine</hi> was the Author of that <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> I ſhould have thought it had been ſome Reprobate that had done it, purpoſely to make the Saints ridiculous.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115411:111"/> For if this be not the character of a man abſolutely diſengag'd from the ſentiments which the Goſpel obliges him to renounce; I muſt confeſs, I know not what it means. See then, ſayes he, how ſtrangely you are to ſeek in it. For theſe are the <hi>Symptomes of a weak and unrefined diſpoſition, ſuch as hath not thoſe generous and natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it ought to have,</hi> as Father <hi>le Moine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes in the concluſion of that deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By this means it is that <hi>he teaches Chriſtian virtue and Philoſophy, according to the deſign he had in that work, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in his preface.</hi> Nor indeed can it be deny'd, but that this method of treating of Devotion is much better receiv'd in the world, then what was practiſed before us. There's no compariſon between them, ſaid I, and I now begin to hope that you will make good your word to me. You will find it much more clear, ſaith he, by what follows; I have as yet ſpoken onely of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>general.</hi> But that you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>particulars</hi> what difficulties our Fathers have weeded out of it, is it not a buſineſs of extraordinary comfort for the <hi>ambitious</hi> to be perſwaded that true devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not inconſiſtent with an inordinate love fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115411:111"/> ſaid I, though they endeavour it with ever ſo much exceſs? Though they did, ſayes he; for it were ſtill but a <hi>venial</hi> ſin, unleſs a man ſhould deſire that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs purpoſely to offend God, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his Countrey with greater conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now venial ſins do not hinder a man from being devout, ſince the greateſt Saints have not been free from them. Hear what <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſayes <hi>tr.</hi> 2 <hi>ex.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 17. <hi>Ambition, which is an inordinate deſire of dignity and greatneſs, is of it ſelf a</hi> veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>ſin; but when a man covets that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prejudice the State, or to have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter convenience to offend God, theſe external circumſtances make it</hi> mortal.</p>
               <p>This begins excellently well, ſaid I. But is it not alſo, continued he, a very gentle doctrine for the covetous, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, as <hi>Eſcobar</hi> does, <hi>tr.</hi> 5. <hi>ex.</hi> 5. <hi>num.</hi> 154. <hi>I know that rich men do not ſin mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they do not give almes of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, in the great neceſſities of the poor: Scio in gravi pauperum neceſſitate divites, non dando ſuperflua, non peccare mortaliter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Certainly if this be true, ſaid I, I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to ſeek what ſin is. To make it more clear to you, ſayes he, do you not think that the good opinion a man hath of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115411:112"/> himſelf, and the complacency he takes in his own works, is a ſin, and that one of the moſt dangerous? And will you not be aſtoniſh'd if I make it appear, that though this good opinion or ſelf love be abſolutely groundleſs, yet is it ſo far from being a ſin, that, on the contrary, it is a gift of God? Is it poſſible, ſaid I? We have it, ſayes he, in our great Father <hi>Garaſſus,</hi> in his book intituled, <hi>The Summary of the principal Truths of Religion,</hi> part 2. page 419. <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>an effect of commutative juſtice, that all hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When great wits are delivered of ſome excellent work, they are justly recompenſed with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick acclamations. But when an ordinary ingenuity takes a great deal of pains to do ſomewhat that amounts to very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo conſequently cannot pretend to any publick applauſe, that his labour may not go without reward, God gives him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſonal complacency, which, without an injuſtice more then barbarous, cannot be envy'd him. Thus doth God, who is juſt, give the very frogs a certain ſatisfaction in their croaking.</hi>

And that is a mortal ſin:</hi> I cannot imagine Father, ſaid I, that there ever hath been any one ſo fantaſtick as to bethink himſelf of a ſloth of that nature. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> indeed, replies he, does ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſay, <hi>n.</hi> 105. <hi>I must confeſs, it ſeldome happens that any one ever falls into the ſin of ſloth.</hi> Do you not perceive hereby of what conſequence it is to define things well?

               <p>It is not alwayes neceſſary, reply'd he, upon this ground to change the definitions of things. You will find it ſo upon the ſubject of <hi>good cheer,</hi> which undoubtedly is

               </p>
               <p>Speak ingenuouſly, have not you been often at a loſs for want of this knowledge? Now and then, ſaid I, And will you not acknowledge, that it were many times no ſmall advantage to be diſpenſ'd in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that by the meer obſervation of certain words? It were indeed, Father, ſaid I, the greateſt convenience in the world. Hear <hi>Eſcobar</hi> then, <hi>tr.</hi> 3. <hi>ex.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 48. where he gives this general rule. <hi>Promiſes oblige not, when a man hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to engage himſelf when he makes them. Now it ſeldome happens that a man hath that intention, unleſs he be bound by oath or Contract. So that when one ſayes ſimply, I will do ſuch a thing, it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he will do it if his mind alter not. For no man will upon that account deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his liberty.</hi> He furniſhes you with other wayes which you may conſult your ſelf, and ſo concludes, ſaying, <hi>that all is taken out of</hi> Molina <hi>and other Authors of

               <p>Well Father, ſaid I, I knew not that the direction of the <hi>intention</hi> had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to null promiſes. And yet you ſee, ſayes the Father, what an eaſe this is in the affairs of the world. But that wherein we met with moſt trouble was to regulate the converſation between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women;</hi> for our Fathers have been very ſtrict as to what relates to <hi>chaſtity.</hi> Not but that they treat of queſtions of much curioſity and niceneſs as to that point, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they have to do with perſons that are either <hi>married</hi> or <hi>contracted.</hi> This brought into play the moſt extravagant, and the moſt obſcene queſtions that can fall into mans imagination. He cited as many as might very well furniſh me with matter for divers Letters, but I ſhall not ſo much as give you the citations, becauſe you ſhew my Letters to all perſons indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and I ſhould be loth to find enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for ſuch as make no other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their reading then their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The onely thing I dare quote to you of all he ſhewed me in their books, is, what
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115411:116"/> you have in Father <hi>Bauny</hi>'s <hi>Summary of Sins,</hi> pag. 165 concerning certain little privacies which be there explaines, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a man direct his intention aright, <hi>as to paſs for a Gallant;</hi> and you will wonder to find in <hi>pag.</hi> 148 a principle of Morality concerning the power which he ſayes that Virgins have to diſpoſe of their virginity without the conſent of Parents; to this effect. <hi>When that is done with the conſent of the Maid, though the Father have juſt cauſe to be troubled at t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This put me in mind of a paſſage in a Heathen Poet, who was certainly a better Caſuiſt then theſe Fathers, ſince he affirmes, <hi>that a Maid's Virginity does not abſolutely belong to her ſelf; that one part bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ut whom ſhe cannot diſpoſe of it, no, not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to marriage.</hi> And I much queſtion whether there be any Judge, that being to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115411:116"/> make a Law in this caſe would not take the clear contrary to this Maxime of Father <hi>Bauny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all I can afford you of the whole diſcourſe that paſſed between us; and which laſted ſo long that I was forced to entreat the Father to pitch upon another ſubject. He did ſo, and entertain'd me with certain regulations about <hi>Womens cloths,</hi> to this effect. We ſhall ſay nothing of thoſe who are guilty of any diſhoneſt inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the reſt; <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſayes, <hi>tr</hi> 1. <hi>ex.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 5. <hi>If a woman dreſs her ſelf gorgeouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any evil intention, but onely to comply with the natural inclination ſhe hath to be vaine, ob naturalem faſtûs inclinationem, either it is but a venial ſin, or it is no ſin at all.</hi> And Father <hi>Bauny</hi> in his <hi>Summary of Sins, c.</hi> 46. <hi>pag.</hi> 1094. ſayes, that, <hi>though a woman be ſenſible of the ill effect her curioſity in dreſſing her ſelf would work both in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſouls of thoſe who ſhould ſee her in rich and gorgeous apparel yet were it no ſin at all in her to make uſe thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And he cites, among others, our Father <hi>Sanchez,</hi> as being of the ſame opinion.</p>
               <p>But Father, ſaid I, what anſwer can your Authors make to thoſe paſſages of <hi>Scripture</hi> which ſpeak ſo expreſly againſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115411:117"/> the leaſt things of that kind? <hi>Leſſius,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he, hath fully ſalv'd all, in his book <hi>de Juſt. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> 14. <hi>n.</hi> 11. ſaying, that thoſe places of Scripture were precepts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected onely to the women of that time, that by their modeſty they might give ſuch example as ſhould be for the edification of the heathen. And whence took he that note, ſaid I? It matters not whence he had it, reply'd he; it is ſufficient that the ſentiments of theſe great men do alwayes imply a probability in themſelves. But Father <hi>le Moine</hi> does ſomewhat moderate that general permiſſion; for he will not allow it in <hi>ancient</hi> women: it is in his <hi>Eaſie Devotion;</hi> and among other places, in <hi>pag.</hi> 127. 157. 163. <hi>Youth,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>may, by a certaine natural right, dress it ſelf more then ordinary. Gorgeous attire is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in an age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is, as it were, the flower and prime of life. But a man muſt accordingly confine himſelf thereto; it were as extravagant to do it in a ſeaſon contrary to that, as to think to gather roſes in the ſnow. It is a prerogative of the ſtars onely to be alwayes as it were in the Ball, as flouriſhing in perpetual youth. The ſafeſt courſe then were, for a man to take the advice of his reaſon and a good looking-glaſs, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115411:117"/> comply as well with decency as neceſsity; and then withdraw when night approches.</hi> This indeed argues abundance of judgment, ſaid I. But that you may ſee, continu'd he, how generally provident our Fathers have been, I am to tell you, that in regard it would be many times to no purpoſe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low young women to trim up themſelves, if they have not money at their own diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, there is another maxime eſtabliſh'd for their encouragement. You have it in <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> in the Chapter <hi>of Theft. tr.</hi> 1. <hi>ex:</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 13. <hi>A woman,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>may take money from her h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In troth Father, this comes off excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well. There are a many other things, reply'd he, might be inſiſted on, but we muſt omit them, to ſpeak of thoſe important Maximes which facilitate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of holy things, as for inſtance, the manner of hearing <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Our greateſt Divines, <hi>Gaſper Hurtado, de Sacr. to.</hi> 2. <hi>d.</hi> 5. <hi>diſt.</hi> 2. and <hi>Conink q.</hi> 83. <hi>a.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 197<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have taught as to this buſineſs; <hi>That it is enough to be bodily preſent at Maſſe, though a man be abſent as to the mind; provided he

                  </gap>d not to hear it. I ſhould never have believed it, ſaid I, if another had told me ſo much. To be ſhort, ſayes he, this is a thing which ſtands in ſome need of the authority of theſe great men; as alſo what <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſayes in <hi>tr.</hi> 1. <hi>ex.</hi> 11. <hi>num.</hi> 31. <hi>That a wicked intention, as haply that of looking on women with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure deſire, joyned with that of hearing Maſſe as a man ought, hinders not a man from fully performing the duty;</hi> nec obeſt alia prava intentio, ut aſpiciendi libidinoſè faeminas.</p>
               <p>But there is yet a thing of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry convenience in our learned <hi>Turrianus, Select. p.</hi> 2. <hi>d.</hi> 16. <hi>dub</hi> 7. <hi>That a man may hear one half of a Maſs from one Prieſt, and afterward: the other half from another; nay that he may firſt hear the latter part of one, and afterwards the beginning of another.</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:115411:118"/> Nay to be free with you, it is further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable <hi>to hear two halves of a Maſſe at the ſame time, from two ſeveral Prieſts, as if one begins Maſſe, when the other is at the elevation, becauſe a man may direct his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention both thoſe wayes at the ſame time; and two halves of a Maſs make a whole one.

In troth Father, ſaid I, I rannot forbear giving you my thoughts of it, I fear me you over-ſhoot your ſelves, and that this indulgence is much more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to frighten the world from you then to draw them to you. For the Maſs, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is a thing ſo high and ſo holy, that it were enough to diſcredit your Authors with moſt people, but to ſhew them after what manner they ſpeak of it. This is very true, ſayes the Father, in relation to ſome people; but do you not know that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate our ſelves to all? You ſeem

This put the good Father to a little loſſe, who yet endeavour'd rather to ſhift off the difficulty then reſolve it, by bringing upon the ſtage another rule of theirs, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces a freſh confuſion, and does not in the leaſt confirme this deciſion of Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> which, in my judgement is one of their moſt pernicious maximes, and ſuch as is onely fit to encourage wicked men in their evil courſes. I grant you, ſaid he, that the habit of ſinning addes to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of ſinne, but it changes not its nature; and that is the reaſon why a man is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd

               <p>And yet all this, replyed he, would come to nothing if there were not alſo a miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Penance,</hi> which is that that moſt of all deterres men from <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> But now it is ſo qualifi'd, that even the moſt delicate need not be frightned at it, after what we have maintain'd in our <hi>Theſes</hi> of the Colledge of <hi>Clermont;</hi> That if <hi>the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor impoſe a penance proportionable to the offence, convenientem, and that a man will not ſubmit thereto, he may be quit by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing both the abſolution and the Penance impoſed.

You are miſtaken, reply'd he for there is ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſ'd by way of penance for form ſake. But Father, ſaid I, Do you think that man fit to receive abſolution, that is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115411:123"/> unwilling to ſuffer any thing that is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or afflict ve to expiate his offences? And when men are in ſuch a condition, ſhould you not rather <hi>bind</hi> their ſinnes then <hi>looſe</hi> them? Have you the true Idea of your Miniſtery, and know not that you are therein to exerciſe the power of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing?</hi> Do you think it lawfull to give abſolution indifferently to all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, without ever examining before hand whether I. <hi>Chriſt</hi> looſes thoſe in Heaven whom you abſolve on earth? How reply'd the Father, do you imagine us ignorant, <hi>That the Confeſſor ought to judge of the dispoſition of his Penitent, as well becauſe he is oblig'd not to diſpenſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to thoſe that are unworthy thereof, I. Christ having enjoyn'd him to be a faithfull Steward, and not to caſt that which is holy unto Dogs; as alſo becauſe he is a Judge, and that it is the duty of a Judge to do juſtice in looſing thoſe that deſerve it, and binding thoſe that do not: and laſtly becauſe he ought not to acquit thoſe whom I. Chriſt condemnes.</hi> Whoſe words are theſe Father, ſaid I? Our Father <hi>Filiutiu's;</hi> reply'd he, to 1. tr. 7. <hi>Num.</hi> 354. You make me admire, ſaid I, I ſhould rather have taken them to be one of the Fathers of the Church. But Father,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115411:124"/> this paſſage might well ſtartle all Confeſſors and make them very circumſpect in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of this Sacrament, ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine well, whether their Penitents be ſufficiently contrite, and ſee that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they make not to ſinne for the future be admittable. There's no difficulty at all in it, replyes the Father, <hi>Filiutius</hi> hath been more carefull then to leave Confeſſors in any trouble, and therefore gives them immediately after thoſe words this eaſy method to avoid it. <hi>The Confeſſor ſhall not need be in any trouble as concerning the diſpoſition of his Penitent. For if he diſcover not ſufficient expreſſions of his remorſe, the Confeſſor hath no more to do then to ask him whether he doth not in his ſoul deteſt his ſinne: to which if he anſwer that he doth, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to believe him. The ſame thing is to be ſaid of Reſolutions made for the future, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there happen to be ſome obligation to make reſtitution, or to avoid ſome next occaſion.</hi> For this paſſage Father, ſaid I, it is eaſily ſeen it comes from <hi>Filiutius.</hi> You are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, ſayes the Father, he hath taken it <hi>verbatim</hi> out of <hi>Suazez</hi> in 3. <hi>part. to.</hi> 4. <hi>diſp.</hi> 32. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 2. But Father, ſaid I, this latter paſſage of <hi>Filiutius</hi> deſtroyes what he had aſſerted in the former. For he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115411:124"/> utterly deveſts the Confeſſors of all power of being <hi>Judges</hi> of the diſpoſition of their penitents, when he obliges them to take their own words, even when they do not diſcover a ſufficient remorſe of conſcience. Or is there ſuch an infallibility in their bare aſſertions that that ſimple expreſſion is concluſive? I much feare me, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have but too much experience that all thoſe who make ſuch promiſes keep them not ſo exactly, nay, I am miſtaken if they do not often find the contrary. It matters not, ſayes the Father, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are nevertheleſſe oblig'd to believe them. For Father <hi>Bauny</hi> who hath ſifted this queſtion very narrowly in his <hi>Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of ſinnes, chap. 46. p. 1090. 1091. and 1092. concludes, <hi>that whenſoever thoſe, who are ſo far guilty of frequent relapſes, that no amendment can be perceiv'd, caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the feet of the Confeſſor, and tell him that they are ſorry for what is paſt, and will be reformed for the future, he ought to believe them though upon no other ground then that of their bare aſſertions, though it may well be preſum'd that ſuch reſolutions proceed not but from the teeth outward. Nay though they are afterwards more violently carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the ſame ſinnes, yet ought they not,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115411:125"/> in my opinion, to be deny'd abſolution.</hi> Now am I confident that all your doubts are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed.</p>
               <p>But Father, ſaid I, me thinkes you put the Confeſſors to a great inconvenience when you oblige them to believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they ſee. You apprehend not, ſaid he, the buſineſſe right, that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more then that they are to act and abſolve as if they did believe that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to be good and firm, though in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they believe the contrary. And ſo are the fore-recited paſſages explained by our Fathers <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Filiutius.</hi> For having affirm'd, <hi>that the Priest is obliged to believe his penitent upon his own word,</hi> they adde, <hi>that there is no neceſſity the Confeſſor ſhould be perſwaded that the reſolution of his Penitent will be executed, nor indeed that he think it probably may: but it is ſufficient, that he imagine that at that inſtant he hath ſome ſuch intention in generall, though he expect he ſhould fall again in a ſhort time. And this is unanimouſly the doctrine of all our Authors. Ita docent omnes authores.</hi> Will you doubt of a thing taught by all our Authors? What then Father, ſaid I, will become of that acknowledgment which Father <hi>Petavius</hi> was forc'd to make in the preface before his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115411:125"/> book of <hi>Publick Penance</hi> p. 4. <hi>That the holy Fathers, Doctors, and Councels unanimou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly agree and hold as an infallible truth, that the Penance which is preparatory to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, ought to be full of reality, constancy and courage, not lazy and lukewarme, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to backſlidings and relapſes?</hi> Do you not perceive, reply'd he, that Father <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> ſpeaks of the ancient Church? but this now is ſo far <hi>unſeaſonable,</hi> to uſe the expreſſions of our Fathers, that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> the contrary onely is true, tis in tr. 4. <hi>q.</hi> 15. p. 95. <hi>Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirme that Abſolution ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed thoſe who fall often into the ſame ſinnes, and that especially when, after they had been diverſe times abſolved, there is not the leaſt appearance of any amendment; and there are others that hold the contrary.

               <p>Well Father, ſaid I, the <hi>obligation</hi> to quit occaſions of ſinning is certainly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with very eaſie <hi>conditions,</hi> if the leaſt enſuing inconvenience makes it void; but if I miſtake not, a man is obliged thereto, even according to your Fathers, when there is no trouble at all. Tis very true, reply'd he, though this, as a generall rule, is not without ſome exception. For Father <hi>Bauny</hi> ſayes in the ſame place: <hi>It is lawfull for perſons of all qualities, conditions and ſexes to go into the places of common proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there to convert ſinfull women, though it be very probable that they will commit ſinne there themſelves, nay haply though they have found by frequent experience that they are drawn into ſinne by the very ſight and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of ſuch women. And though there are ſome Doctors who approve not of this opinion, and do abſolutely believe, that it is not lawful for a man to hazard his own ſalvation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his neighbour, yet ſhall I not ſtick to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the opinion they oppoſe.</hi> Theſe, Father, ſaid I, are a new ſort of <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> but upon what ground is it that Father <hi>Bauny</hi> gives them this <hi>Miſſion?</hi> upon a certain principle of his own, cited by him out of <hi>Baſilius Pontius.</hi> I have given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115411:128"/> of it formerly, and I think you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but remember it.

               <p>How is that, ſayes the good Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me at thoſe words, it ſeemes then you read our Authors? Tis very well done; but it were better that when you do read them, it were with ſome of us. Do you not perceive, that, becauſe you have read them alone you conclude that thoſe paſſages do ſomewbat prejudice thoſe who now maintaine our doctrine of <hi>attrition,</hi> whereas we ſhould have ſhewn you that nothing addes more to their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For what glory is it to our preſent Fathers, that they have of a ſudden ſo generally ſpread their opinion, that, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines excepted there's hardly any one but imagines, that what we now hold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attrition, was, from the beginning, the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115411:129"/> abſolute Creed of the faithfull. So that when you demonſtrate by our very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that not many yeares ſince, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was not certain, what do you but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the honour of this eſtabliſhment to our lateſt Authors?</p>
               <p>Thus our intimate Friend <hi>Diana</hi> thought he put an obligation upon us, by laying down the ſeveral degrees whereby it is come to this height. This he does p. 5. tr. 13. where he ſaith, <hi>That heretofore the ancient Schoolemen held that a man had no ſooner committed a mortall ſinne, but he ſtood in need of contrition. But ſince it hath been believed that a man is not oblig'd thereto but onely on feſtivall dayes. Afterwards it was thought neceſſary onely when the people ſtood in feare of ſome great calamity. That according to others, a man was oblig'd not to delay it long when neere death. But that our Fathers</hi> Hurtado <hi>and</hi> Vaſques <hi>have very excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted all theſe opinions, and demonſtrate that a man is not oblig'd thereto ſave when he cannot be abſolv'd any other way, or at the point of death.</hi> But to proceed to the miraculous progreſſe of this doctrine, I ſhall adde, that our Fathers, <hi>Fagundez, praec.</hi> 2 c. 4. n. 13. <hi>Granados,</hi> in 3. p. <hi>contr.</hi> 7. <hi>tr.</hi> 3. d. 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 17. and <hi>Eſcobar, tr.</hi> 7.

                  <hi>ex.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 88. in the <hi>Practiſe of our Society,</hi> have decided, <hi>That contrition is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary even at the point of death, becauſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if attrition with the Sacrament be not ſufficient at the point of death, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that attrition were not ſufficient with the Sacrament.</hi> And our learned <hi>Hurtado, de ſacr. d.</hi> 6. cited by <hi>Diana. part</hi> 4. <hi>tr.</hi> 4. <hi>Miſcell. R.</hi> 193. and by <hi>Eſcobar. tr.</hi> 7. <hi>ex.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 91. goes yet further, for he ſayes. <hi>Is that remorſe which proceeds purely from a mans reflection on the temporall inconvenience following upon the ſinne he hath committed (as the loſſe of health, or mony) ſufficient or no? We muſt diſtinguiſh. If he look not on that evil or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience as coming from the hand of God, the remorſe is not ſufficient; but if he believe that it does come from God, as in effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all evill, as Diana ſayes, except that of ſinne, comes from him, ſuch a remorſe is ſufficient.

I ſhould indeed have thought ſo, as well as you, reply'd he, and yet there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it ſhould be otherwiſe.

               <p>I am of your mind, Father, ſaid I, but give me leave to give you my thoughts of it, and diſcover to you what exceſſes this doctrine runs into, when you affirme that Attrition wrought in a man by the meer fear of torment, is, with the Sacrament, ſufficient to juſtifie ſinners, does it not cleerly follow, that people may expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their ſins all their life in that manner, and conſequently be ſaved without ever having loved God in their lives? Durſt your Fathers maintain this?

That's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the lateſt I cannot be perſwaded it ought to be done at every reception of ſome ſacrament. For in that caſe, Attrition with Confeſſion is ſufficient, if it ſtand with a mans convenience.</hi> Suarez ſayes, <hi>that a man is obliged thereto at ſome certain time. But what? Of that he leaves you to be judge your ſelf, as not knowing what to ſay to it. Now what that Doctor knew not, I know not who does know.</hi> And in fine, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that a man is not, in rigor, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to any thing but the obſervation of the other commandments without any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards God, or reſignation of our hearts to him, provided that we do not hate him. This is that he would prove throughout all his ſecond Treatiſe. You cannot but ſee it in every page, and among the reſt in the 16.19.24.28. where he hath theſe words. <hi>God, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love him, is ſatisfied if we do but obey him in his other Commandments. If God had ſaid, I will deſtroy you, how
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115411:132"/> obedient ſoever you may be to me, if you do not withall give me your hearts, were this a motive proportionable to the end which God might and ought to propoſe to himſelf? It is therefore ſaid, that we ſhall love God by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, as if we had for him all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that could be, that is, as if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of charity enclined us thereto. If this really happen, 'tis ſo much the better; if not, we ſhall nevertheleſs, in rigor, ſtill obey the commandment of Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by doing the works thereof. So that, (do but obſerve the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God) we are not ſo much command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love him, as not to hate him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have our Fathers diſengaged men from that irkſome obligation of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God actually. And this doctrine is of ſo great importance, that our Fathers <hi>Annat, Pintereau, le Moine,</hi> and <hi>A. Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> himſelf, have very vigorouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, when ſome made it very much their buſineſs to oppoſe it.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115411:133"/> of this Doctrine.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle the moſt ſacred rules of Chriſtian conduct extends to an abſolute over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law of God. You violate <hi>the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115411:134"/> great Commandement on which hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> You give Piety an aſſault in the very heart; you deprive it of that ſpirit whence it derives all vigour and life. You affirme the love of God not to be neceſſary to ſalvation; nay your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is ſuch as to pretend that this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from the love of God is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that the world derives from JESUS CHRIST. This certainly is the very height of impiety. The price of the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall be to procure us a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from loving him. Before the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> men were oblig'd to love God, but ſince that <hi>God hath ſo loved the World as to beſtow on it his onely Sonne,</hi> the world redeem'd by him, ſhall be diſcharged from loving him.

That men ſhould preſume to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that Anathema which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces againſt <hi>thoſe who love not the Lord</hi> JESUS. That which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſayes is clearely blown away, that <hi>he who loveth not remaines in death;</hi> nay what is ſaid by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, that, <hi>he who loves him not keepeth not his commandemenss.</hi> Thus do they make thoſe worthy the enjoyments of God in Eternity who never lov'd God in their lives. Behold the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd!
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115411:134"/> Open your eyes at length, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if you have not been mov'd by the other extravagances of your Caſuiſts, let the extraordinarineſſe of thoſe laſt draw you out of them.

               <p>After ſome other diſcourſe of this kind, I took leave of the Father.

               <p>I have met with the <hi>letters</hi> which you ſcatter abroad in anſwer to thoſe I have written to one of my friends, a PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINCIALL, upon occaſion of your <hi>Morality,</hi> wherein one of the principall points of your vindication, is, that I have not been ſerious enough when I have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of your <hi>maximes.</hi> And this you repeat over and over in all your writings, and preſſe ſo much as to affirme <hi>I make sport with holy things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reproch, Fathers, as it is very much unexpected, ſo is it no leſs unjuſt. For where do you find me ſporting with holy things? you particularly inſtance in in the Contract MOHATRA, and the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of JOHN D'ALBA. But are thoſe the things which you call <hi>holy?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:115411:135"/>
               <p>Do you look on the <hi>Mohatra</hi> as a thing that requires ſo much veneration that it is blaſphemy not to ſpeak of it with reſpect? and for Father' <hi>Bauny</hi>'s Lectures, concerning <hi>Theft,</hi> whereby <hi>John 'd Alba</hi> was induc'd to commit it againſt your ſelves, are they ſo ſacred, that you have a priviledge to treat thoſe as Reprobates that laugh at them?</p>
               <p>What, Fathers, muſt the imaginations of your Authors be receiv'd for ſuch truths as wherein our Faith is concern'd; and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot make ſport with the paſſages of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> and the fantaſtick and diſ-chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-like deciſions of your other Authors, but they muſt be charg'd with ſcoffing at Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it poſſible you ſhould preſume to repeat ſo often a thing ſo irrationall? Or are you not afraid, when you blame me for cenſuring your extravagancies, to give me freſh occaſion to laugh at the reproch, and to return it upon your own heads, by ſhewing, that I have not taken occaſion to laugh at any thing but what is ridiculous in your books; and conſequently that when I make ſport with your Morality, I am ſo far from jeſting with holy things, as the doctrine of your <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> is different from the holy precepts of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:115411:136"/>
               <p>There is certainly, Fathers, a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between laughing at Religion and laughing at thoſe that profane it by their extravagant opinions. It were impiety to want a reſpect for the truthes which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath reveal'd; but it were no leſſe impiety to want a contempt for the falſities which the ſpirit of man oppoſes thereto.</p>
               <p>For, Fathers, ſince you force me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in this diſcourſe, I beſeech you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſtian verities require love and reſpect, ſo the errours contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſerve onely ſcorn and deteſtation. The reaſon whereof, is, that as there are two things in the Truths of Religion, a divine <hi>beauty,</hi> that renders them amiable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting, and a ſacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which makes them dreadfull and venerable; ſo are there likewiſe two things in Errours; <hi>impiety</hi> rendring them horrid; and <hi>impertinence,</hi> making them ridiculous. And therefore as the Saints have ever, for truth, theſe two ſentiments of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and that their wiſdome is comprehended between Feare, the <hi>beginning,</hi> and Love the <hi>end</hi> of it; ſo have they for errour theſe two ſentiments, of <hi>deteſtation</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> and their zeal is equally taken up to oppoſe, by force, the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115411:136"/> malice of the impious, and, with ſcoffing, to confute their folly and extravagance.</p>
               <p>Flatter not your ſelves therefore Fathers, with any hope to make the world believe, that it is a thing unbeſeeming a Chriſtian to treat errours with ſcorne, ſince it is an eaſie matter to ſatisfy thoſe that know not ſo much, that this kind of proceeding is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtifiable, that it is frequent among the Fathers of the Church, and is authoriſed by the Scripture, and the examples of the greateſt Saints, nay by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>For do we not find, that God at the ſame time both hates and ſcornes ſinners, nay ſo far, that even at the houre of their death, a time when their condition is moſt ſad and deplorable, the divine wiſdome joynes laughter and ſcorne to that venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and indignation which ſhall turn them over into eternall puniſhment? <hi>I will alſo laugh at your deſtruction, and mock when your feare cometh.</hi> And the <hi>Saints</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the ſame ſpirit ſhall do the like, ſince that, according to <hi>David,</hi> when they ſee the deſtruction of the wicked, <hi>they ſhall feare and laugh at it the ſame time; Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt juſti, &amp; timebunt, &amp; ſuper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:115411:137"/>
               <p>But it is a thing very remarkable upon this occaſion, that in the firſt words which God ſaid to man after his fall, we find a ſcoffing diſcourſe, and, according to the Fathers, a bitter Irony. For when <hi>Adam</hi> had broken the commandement out of the hope which the Devil had put him into of being made like unto God, it is apparent out of the Scripture, that God, for his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment made him ſubject to death, and yet after he had brought him into that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the reward of his ſinne, he yet laugh'd at him in that poſture with theſe ſcoffing expreſſions. <hi>Behold man is become like one of us.</hi> Which is <hi>a ſharpe and biting Irony,</hi> wherewith God <hi>reprov'd him moſt bitterly,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d his interpreters. <hi>Adam,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, deſerv'd to be ſcoff'd at by that Irony, and this ironicall expreſſion made him more fully ſenſible of his indiſcretion then a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one could have done.</hi> And <hi>Hugo de Saint Victor,</hi> having affirmed the ſame thing, addes, <hi>that this irony was a juſt reward for his ſottiſh credulity, and that this kind of raillery is an act of juſtice when he on whom it is beſtowed hath deſerv'd it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee then, Fathers, that deriſion is ſometimes the fitteſt way to reduce men
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115411:137"/> out of their extravagances, and that it is at that time an action of juſtice, becauſe as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>the actions of thoſe who go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, are worthy to be laugh'd at by reaſon of th ir vanity: Vana ſunt &amp; riſu digna.</hi> And it is ſo far from impiety to deride them, that it is an argument of divine wiſdome, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Saint <hi>Auguſtine. The wiſe laugh at the indiſcreet, becauſe they are wiſe, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own wiſdome, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome which ſhall laugh at the death of the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the <hi>Prophets,</hi> filled with the ſpirit of God, have made uſe of theſe deriſions, as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and <hi>Eliah.</hi> In a word, the very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of JESUS CHRIST himſelf are not without example thereof. And it is the obſervation of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that when he would humble <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who thought himſelf very well skill'd in the law, <hi>ſeeing him much lifted up with pride by his quality of Doctor among the Jewes, he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and brings down his preſumption by the depth of his demands, and reduc'd him to an incapacity of anſwering. What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he to him, are you a Maſter in Iſrael, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe things? Which is as much as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115411:138"/> that you know nothing.</hi> And Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> affirme upon that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that he deſerved to be ſo derided.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, Fathers, that if it ſhould happen at this day that ſuch as pretend to be <hi>maſters</hi> among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> be ignorant of the <hi>principles</hi> of Religion, and maintaine, for inſtance, <hi>that a man may be ſaved without ever loving God in all his life,</hi> he did but follow the example of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that ſhould laugh at their ignorance and their vanity.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, Fathers, but theſe ſacred examples are ſufficient to convince you that it is not a proceeding contrary to that of the Saints to laugh at the errours and extravagances of men; otherwiſe you muſt quarrell with that of the greateſt Doctors of the Church, who have practiſ'd it. And among theſe may be numbred S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his letters, and in his writings againſt <hi>Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Vigilantius</hi> and the <hi>Pelagians; Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> in his Apologetick againſt the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Idolaters: Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Religious men of <hi>Africk,</hi> whom he calls the <hi>Hairy men:</hi> Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Gnoſticks;</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and other Fathers of the Church, who having
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115411:138"/> been imitators of the Apoſtles, are to be imitated by the faithfull in all times, ſince that they are propoſ'd, let men ſay what they will, as a true modell for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians even of theſe dayes.</p>
               <p>And this made me the more confident I could not do amiſſe while I followed them. Which ſince I have ſufficiently ſhewn that I have done, I have no more to ſay to this point, but onely thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all my procedure. <hi>What I have done is but as it were a triall of skill before a ſet combat. I have rather ſhewn you the wounds might be given you, then give you any. If there are ſome paſſages at which a man cannot well forbear laughing, it muſt be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the ſubject treated of, inclining thereto. There are a many things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be thus laughed at, and made sport with, lest we might be thought to attribute any weight thereto by oppoſing them ſeriouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There's nothing more ſuitable to Vanity then Deriſion, and it is a priviledge proper to Truth to laugh, becauſe ſhe is cheerfull, and to ſcorne her enemies, becauſe ſhe is confident of Victory. Tis true, great care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that the raillery be not flat and unworthy of Truth. But keeping cloſe to that, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What think you, Fathers, is not this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage very pertinent to our ſubject? <hi>What I have done is onely a tryall of skill before a combat.</hi> I have been all this while onely in jeſt, and <hi>have rather ſhewn you the wounds you might receive, then given you any.</hi> I have ſimply laid down your paſſages, without making any reflection thereupon, <hi>if there hath happened any occaſion of laughing, it is becauſe the ſubject was inclinable theret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115411:139"/> four parts of a Maſſe at the ſame time from ſeverall prieſts;</hi> when, I ſay, a man meets with theſe deciſions, and others of the ſame mettall, it is impoſſible but that ſuch an eluſion of the expectation muſt needs cauſe laughter, for nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines thereto, then an incredible diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between what a man lookes for and what he finds. And indeed how could a man otherwiſe treat of the greateſt part of theſe matters, ſince that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to <hi>speak ſeriouſly of them were to countenance them.</hi> What, muſt we bring in <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> to ſhew that for a man to run his enemy through behind his back, or to do it in an ambuſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to kill him treacherouſly; and that to buy a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice is to give mony as the motive of the reſignation thereof? There are therefore ſome things fit to be contemn'd, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve onely to be laughed at and made ſport with.</hi> In a word, what this ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſayes, <hi>that nothing is more ſuitable to Vanity then Deriſion,</hi> and indeed the whole paſſage comes ſo ſuitably and with ſo much conviction to our purpoſe, that it is no longer to be queſtioned, whether er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours may be laugh'd at without running into any <hi>indecorum.</hi> Nay, Fathers I ſhall
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115411:140"/> affirme they may be laughed at without any breach of <hi>charity,</hi> though that be one of the things you moſt reproch me with in your writings. For <hi>charity does ſometimes oblige us to laugh at the errours of men, the rather to encline them to laugh thereat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſhun them,</hi> according to the words of Saint <hi>Auguſtine: Haec tu miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricorditer irride, ut eis ridenda &amp; fugienda commendes.</hi> The ſame charity does alſo many times oblige us to give them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe with indignation, according to this ſaying of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen; The ſpirit of mildneſs and charity hath its angry ſallios and emotions.</hi> In a word, as Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who dares affirms that truth ought to remain weaponleſs to deal with falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and that it is lawful for the enemies of Religion to frighten the faithful with high words, and to divert them by pleaſant paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but that the Catholicks ſhould not write but with a certain coldneſs of ſtyle ſuch as might lay the Readers aſleep?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not ſufficiently apparent hence, that according to this procedure we ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the moſt extravagant and moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errours to be brought into the Church, when it ſhall not be lawful to ſlight and abuſe them, for fear of being charg'd
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115411:140"/> with running into an indecorum; nor yet to confute them with violence, for fear of being tax'd with want of charity?</p>
               <p>What, Fathers, you ſhall be allowed to affirme that <hi>one may kill another to avoid an affront, or a box o'th' ear,</hi> and it ſhall not be lawfull publickly to refute a common errour of ſuch conſequence? You are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to hold, <hi>that a Judge may, with a ſafe conſcience, detaire what he had received for giving an unjuſt ſentence,</hi> and others ſhall not have the ſame, to contradict you? You ſhall print with the priviledge and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of your Doctors, <hi>that a man may be ſaved without ever loving God,</hi> and would muzzle their mouthes who would defend that verity of our Faith, by telling them that they are guilty of a breach of fraternal charity, for oppoſing you, and Chriſtian moderation, for laughing at your Maximes. I fear me, Fathers, there are thoſe in the world, whom you could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce to believe ſuch a thing. If there be any ſo perſwaded, and that think I might commit a breach of the charity I owe you, by diſcrediting your <hi>Morality.</hi> I wiſh they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with attention, examin'd whence that ſentiment took its firſt riſe in them. For though they imagine it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115411:141"/> from their zeal, which could not, without ſcandal, ſee their neighbour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, yet I would entreat them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is not impoſſible it might come otherwiſe; nay that it is probable it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from that ſecret, and, many times, even to our ſelves, unknown diſguſt, which the unhappy leaven within us never failes to ſtir up againſt thoſe that endeavour the reformation of manners. And to give them a rule whereby they may diſcover the true principle thereof, I would ask them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſame time that it pitties them to ſee Religious men treated after this rate, they are not more troubled that Religious men ſhould treat Truth as they have done. And if they are incenſed not onely againſt the LETTERS, but alſo againſt the MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>XIMES cited therein, I ſhall acknowledge that their reſentment may haply proceed from ſome zeale, but not well illuminated; and then the paſſage here produc'd will ſufficiently enlighten them. But if their violence be againſt the reprehenſions and not againſt the things reprehended, your Reverences muſt pardon me if I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void telling them, that they are moſt groſly abuſed, and that their zeal is very blind.</p>
               <p>'Tis certainly a ſtrange <hi>zeal</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt thoſe that diſcover publick
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115411:141"/> enormities, and not againſt thoſe that commit them! What new kind of <hi>charity</hi> is this that's offended to ſee manifeſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours baffled meerly by bringing them on the ſtage, and is not mov'd to ſee Morality turn'd upſide down by thoſe errours? If theſe perſons were in danger to be aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, would they be offended with any one that ſhould acquaint them with the ambuſh laid for them, and inſtead of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their way to avoid it, would ſit down and bemone the want of charity in thoſe that diſcovered the wicked deſign of thoſe aſſaſſins? Are they angry when they are forbidden to eat ſuch a meat, becauſe it is poyſoned, or to go into a City when the plague is in it?</p>
               <p>Whence comes it then that they find this want of charity when a man diſcovers Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes prejudicial to <hi>Religion;</hi> &amp; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, think it a great defect of charity not to diſcover things prejudicial to their health and lives; but that the tenderneſs they have for their lives, makes them take kindly whatever contributes to the preſervation thereof, and the indifference they have for Truth, makes them not onely avoid having any part in her vindication, but alſo not a little troubled when they ſee others
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115411:142"/> endeavouring the deſtruction of Falſhood?</p>
               <p>Let them then as in the ſight of God, conſider, how ſhameful and pernicious the <hi>Morality,</hi> which your <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſcatter through all parts, is to the <hi>Church;</hi> how ſcandalous and illimitable the liberty you introduce into Manners, is; with what a violent and obſtinate confidence you maintain them. And if they think it not time to arme againſt ſuch diſorders, their blindneſs is as much to be deplor'd as yours, ſince that both you and they have equal cauſe to fear this ſaying of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> upon that of JESUS CHRIST in the Goſpel; <hi>Wo unto the blind that lead; wo unto the blind that are led: vae caecis du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centibus, vae caecis ſequentibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to the end you may have no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to put theſe impreſſions into others, nor to take them your ſelves. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you Fathers, (and I bluſh that you engage me to acquaint you with what I ſhould have learn'd from you) with the marks which the Fathers of the Church have left us, whereby to diſcern whether reprehenſions proceed from a ſpirit of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and charity, or from a ſpirit of impiety and exaſperation.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe rules, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that the ſpirit
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115411:142"/> of piety enclines a man to ſpeak alwayes with <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>ſincerity,</hi> whereas envy and exaſperation ſpare neither <hi>lyes</hi> nor <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: splendentia &amp; vehementia, ſed rebus veris,</hi> ſayes Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Whoever makes uſe of lying, acts by the ſpirit of <hi>Satan.</hi> There's no <hi>direction of the intention</hi> can rectifie calumny; and were it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the whole earth, it were not lawful to traduce the innocent, becauſe we muſt not commit the leaſt evil to promote the greateſt good, and that <hi>the truth of God doth not ſtand in need of our lying,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>It is the duty of the champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Truth,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Hilary, not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any thing but what is true.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, Fathers, I may ſay, as in the preſence of God, that there is nothing I deteſt more then to do Truth the leaſt violence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and that I have ever been extremely careful, not onely not to falſifie (that were horrid) but even not to alter or diſtract, in the leaſt, the ſenſe of any paſſage. So that if I durſt preſume upon this occaſion to make uſe of the words of the ſame Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> I might ſafely ſay with him: <hi>If we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance things that are untrue, let our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes be reputed infamous; but if we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that what we do produce is publick
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115411:143"/> and manifeſt, it is no breach of moderation, and Apoſtolical Liberty to reprove them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Fathers, it is not enough not to produce any but true things, but we muſt alſo not produce all that are ſuch, becauſe there ought to be alledged onely thoſe things that are requiſite to diſcover, and not thoſe which can onely hurt without any advantage. And ſo, as the firſt rule is to ſpeak with <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uth;</hi> the ſecond is to ſpeak with <hi>diſcretion. Wicked men,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, perſecuting the good, are hurried away with the blind paſſion that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them; whereas the good proſecute the wicked with a prudent diſcretion, as Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions conſider where they cut, whereas mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers care not where they ſtrike.</hi> You know, Fathers, that of the Maximes of your Authors I have not cited thoſe that might have troubled you moſt, though I might have done it without any breach of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> as well as a many learned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, that have done it heretofore. All thoſe who have read your Authors know as well as your ſelves how ſparing I have been to you as to that; beſides that I have not ſaid ought relating to any one in particular; and indeed ſhould be much troubled had I diſcovered any ſecret and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115411:143"/> perſonal miſcarriage, what pregnant proof ſoever I might have of it. For I know it to be the character of envy and animoſity, and that a man ſhould never do it, unleſs there be ſome extraordinary neceſſity for it, as to the benefit of the Church. It is therefore evident that I have have not any wayes been wanting as to modeſty, in what I have been forc'd to ſay concerning the Maximes of your Morality; and that there is much more reaſon you ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my reſervedneſs, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my indiſcretion.</p>
               <p>The third rule, Fathers, is, that when a man is oblig'd to fall into ſomething of ſatyre, the ſpirit of piety inclines him to direct his wit againſt errours, not againſt holy things; whereas the ſpirit of Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phancy, impiety and hereſie makes ſport with what is moſt ſacred. I have already vindicated my ſelf as to this point. And certainly a man, ſpeaking onely of the opinions I have cited out of your Authors, is far enough from being ſubject to that vice.</p>
               <p>In a word to ſhorten theſe rules, I ſhall onely trouble you with this one more, which is t principle &amp; end of all the reſt. And that is, that the ſpirit of <hi>Charity</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115411:144"/> a man to make hearty wiſhes for their ſalvation, againſt whom he ſpeakes; and, when he directs his reproches to men, at the ſame time to addreſſe his prayers to God. <hi>A man ſhould alwayes,</hi> with Saint <hi>Augustine, preſerve charity in his heart, even when he is oblig'd to do outwardly things that, to men, ſeeme very harſh, and to ſmite them with a rough, but obliging ſeverity, their advantage being to be preferr'd before their ſatisfaction.</hi> I am perſwaded, Fathers, that my LETTERS contain not any thing whence it might be inferr'd that I have not had that deſire for you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that Charity obliges you to believe that I really had it, when you can find nothing in them to the contrary. It is therefore evident that you cannot make it appear I have offended either againſt this rule, or indeed againſt any one of thoſe that <hi>charity</hi> obligeth us to obſerve; and therefore you had no reaſon to aver that I had made a breach thereof in what I have done.</p>
               <p>But Fathers, ſince you will needs, be pleaſed, in few words to obſerve a carriage offending againſt all theſe rules, and that hath the right mark of Sycophancy, envy, and uncharitableneſſe I will; give you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115411:144"/> thereof. And that they may be ſuch as are well known to you, I ſhall take them out of your own writings.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the unworthy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein your Authors ſpeak of things ſacred whether it be in their <hi>ralleries,</hi> their <hi>Gallanteries,</hi> or their <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>grave</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, do you think that ſo many ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtories of your Father <hi>Bin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will you affirme, that that profane and ſuperficiall way wherein your Father <hi>le Moine</hi> hath treated of piety in his <hi>eaſy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> is more likely to beget reſpect then contempt for the Idea he would forme of <hi>Chriſtian vertue?</hi> His whole book of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Repreſentation,</hi> does it breath any thing elſe, as well in the proſe as verſe, but a ſpirit full of vanity and the fooleries of the world? Is that a piece beſeeming a Prieſt, that ode, of the ſeventh book, entituled <hi>The elogie of chastity, where it is ſhewn, that all handſome things are red, or ſubject to be red.</hi> This he writ to comfort a certain La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whom he calls <hi>Delphina,</hi> upon her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent bluſhing. In every ſtanza, he takes occaſion to ſay that ſome of thoſe things

               </q>
               <p>What think you of it, Fathers? This preference of the redneſſe of <hi>Delphina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ardor of thoſe ſpirits, who have no other then that of charity, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of a <hi>fanne</hi> to thoſe myſterious <hi>wings,</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:115411:145"/> do you think them very Chriſtian-like in a mouth that conſecrates the adorable body of JESUS CHRIST? I know he ſaid it onely to ſeem a Gallant, and in a merry humour, but this is that which is called <hi>jeſting with holy things.</hi> And is it not true, that if he had juſtice done him, he ſhould not eſcape a cenſure, though, to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he alleged that reaſon, which is not it ſelf leſs cenſurable, produced by him in the firſt book; <hi>That the College of</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne <hi>hath no juriſdiction over</hi> Parnaſſus, <hi>and that the errours of that Countrey are not ſubject to cenſures or the Inquiſition;</hi> as if a man were forbidden to be a Blaſphemer and an Athieſt onely in <hi>Proſe.</hi> Nor would this other paſſage of the Preface before the ſame book ſtand him in much more ſtead; <hi>That the water of the river on whoſe banks he had written his verſes had ſuch a faculty to make Poets, that though it were conſecrated and made holy-water, yet were it not able to chaſe away the Daemon of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> Nor yet that of your Father <hi>Garaſſus</hi> in his <hi>Summary of the principal verities of Religion,</hi> pag. 649. where he joynes <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy</hi> and <hi>hereſie</hi> together; ſpeaking of the ſacred myſterie of the Incarnation in this manner; <hi>The humane Perſonality hath
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115411:146"/> been as it were graffed or ſet on horſe-back upon the perſonality of the Word.</hi> Nor this other paſſage, to omit a many others, of the ſame Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 510. where he ſayes upon occaſion of the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> commonly figured thus,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> IHS</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thus do you unworthily treat of the verities of Religion, contrary to the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable rule whereby we are oblig'd not to ſpeak of them but with reverence. But you no leſs break that which obliges us not to ſpeak but with truth and diſcretion. What is more obvious in your writings then <hi>Calumny?</hi> Does your Father <hi>Briſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier</hi> ſpeak truly and ſincerely, when he ſayes, 4. <hi>part. p.</hi> 24. and 15. <hi>that the Nuns of Port-royal pray not to the Saints, and that they have no images in their Church,</hi> when all <hi>Paris</hi> can witneſs the contrary? And how implacable is he to the innocence of thoſe Religious Women who live ſo virtuouſly and auſterely, when he calls them, <hi>Impenitent Virgins, aſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, in-communicants, fooliſh virgins,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115411:146"/> fantaſtick, Calaganes, deſperate, and what you pleaſe;</hi> and traduces them with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other calumnies, which could do no leſs then deſerve the cenſure of the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> Does he diſcreetly, when he calumniates Prieſts of unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives, ſo far as to affirme 1. <hi>p. pag.</hi> 22. <hi>That they practice Novelties in Confeſſion, to inſnare the handſome and the innocent, and that it were an horrour to him to relate the abominable crimes they commit?</hi> Is it not an unſupportable temerity to advance ſuch horrid impoſtures, not onely without proof, but without the leaſt pretence or probability? I ſhall dilate no further as to this point, and refer the larger diſcourſe I intend you of it to another time: for I have ſomewhat to ſay to this ſubject, and what I have ſaid is enough to let you ſee how far you offend againſt <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> together.</p>
               <p>But it will haply be ſaid that you break not the laſt rule which obliges a man to wiſh their ſalvation whom he ſpeaks againſt, and that none can accuſe you as to that, without ſearching into the ſecret of your hearts, which are known onely to God himſelf. And yet, how ſtrange ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115411:147"/> it might ſeem, there is ſomething to prove you guilty, even of that. For though your uncharitableneſs towards your Adverſaries hath been ſo great as to wiſh their eternal deſtruction; yet ſuch hath been withall your blindneſs that you have diſcovered ſo abominable a wiſh. Nay ſo far have you been from having any ſecret deſires of their ſalvation, that you have publikly prayed for their damnation; and after you had betray'd that impious wiſh in the City of <hi>Caen,</hi> to the ſcandal of the whole Church, you have not bluſh'd afterwards to maintain at <hi>Paris,</hi> even in your printed books, ſo diabolical an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To raile and ſpeak unworthily of what is moſt ſacred; to traduce Virgins and Prieſts falſly and ſcandalouſly; and after all, to wiſh and pray for their damnation, are certainly ſuch exceſſes againſt Piety, as cannot admit any thing beyond them. I know not, Fathers, how you can avoid confuſion, and how it ſhould come into your thoughts to charge me with want of charity, who, in all I have ſaid, have been ſtrictly guided by Truth and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, without making reflections on the horrid breaches of charity, which you
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115411:147"/> your ſelves are guilty of, by ſuch deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable extremities.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, Fathers, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproch you faſten on me, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the great number I produce of your <hi>Maximes,</hi> there are ſome that you had been charg'd with before, whence you take occaſion to be troubled that <hi>I repeat ſome things that had been already ſaid.</hi> I make this anſwer to it, that, in regard you had made no advantage of what had been ſaid to you before, I have purpoſely minded you of it again. For what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hath enſued after that ſo many learned Doctors, nay the whole Univerſitie, have by ſo many books reprov'd you for theſe things? What have your Fathers, <hi>Annat, Cauſin, Pintereau,</hi> and <hi>le Moine</hi> done in the Anſwers they have made thereto, but load thoſe with calumnies who had given you ſuch good counſel? Have you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the books wherein thoſe wicked Maximes were taug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t? Have you ſilenced the Authors? Are you ever the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect? And is it not ſince that time that <hi>Eſcobar</hi> hath been ſo often printed in <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and that your Fathers, <hi>Cellot, Bagot, Bauny, Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115411:148"/> le Moine</hi> and others, make it their buſineſs, more then ever, to publiſh day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame things; nay others, tending more to Libertiniſme then any before? Be not therefore ſo much troubled, Fathers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that I have reproched you with the Maximes you have not quitted, or that I charge you with new ones; or laſtly, that I have laugh'd at all. You need do no more then conſider them well to find therein your own confuſion and my vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Who can without laughter reflect on Father <hi>Bauny</hi>'s deciſion, for him that ſets a mans barn on fire; that of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cellot</hi> concerning reſtitution; <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chez</hi>'s his regulation in favour of Fortune-tellers: the manner how <hi>Hurtado</hi> makes a man avoid the ſin of Duelling, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a field, and there expecting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Father <hi>Bauney</hi>'s Complements, to avoid Uſury; the way to avoid <hi>Simony</hi> by a <hi>ſhift</hi> of the intention, and that of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>lying</hi> by ſpeaking one while aloud, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, low, and ſuch like opinions of the graveſt among your Doctors. Needs there any thing further for my juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>is there ought more ſuitable to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity then Deriſion,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith? But,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115411:148"/> Fathers, the corruption of manners intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by your Maximes deſerves another manner of conſideration, and we may well make this queſtion with the ſame <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian: Ought we to laugh at their folly or bemoane their blindneſs? Rideam Vanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, an exprobrem caecitatem?</hi> I conceive, Fathers, a man is at liberty either to laugh at or lament it: <hi>Haec tolerabiliùs vel riden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vel flentur,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Acknowledge then that <hi>there is a time to laugh and a time to weep,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith. For my part, Fathers, it is my wiſh, that I find not theſe words of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> verified in you; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>if a wiſe man contend with a fooliſh man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be angry or laugh, there is no reſt.</hi>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115411:151"/> give out of that which is <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That out of <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> which is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary relief of the poor, is abſolutely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by this one max me, <hi>de Eleemoſ. c.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 14. cited by me in my LETTERS, <hi>What ever men lay up out of a deſigne to raiſe their own Fortunes, and that of their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not called ſuperfluous. For which reaſon it will be hard to find any among thoſe that are worldly minded, that have ought ſuperfluous, no not even among Kings.</hi> You ſee, Fathers, that, by this definition, thoſe who are any way ambitious, wil never have any thing ſuperfluous, and conſequently that in regard of the greateſt part of men, almes is clearly taken away. But though it ſhould happen that a man had any thing ſupeflruous, yet were be exempted from all charity in the extraordinary neceſſities of the poore, according to <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> who is of a contrary opinion to thoſe who would oblige the rich thereto.

And yet, if a man have not this perſwaſion he may ſend him away without reliefe, according to <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> The other is that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the poor be ſuch, <hi>that he ſtand in feare of ſome mortall accid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115411:152"/> reputation, n.</hi> 24. and 26. which happens very ſeldome. But that which much more argues the rarity of it, is, that he ſayes, <hi>num.</hi> 45. That the poore man, who is in ſuch a condition as wherein there is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to relieve him, <hi>may with a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſteale from the rich man.</hi> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt needs be extraordinary, unleſſe he will have it to be ordinarily lawfull to ſteale. So that after he had abſolutely made the obligation of giving almes out of what is ſuperfluous, the greateſt ſpring of charity of no effect; he obliges not the rich to relieve the poore out of that which is neceſſary, but when he allowes the poor to ſteal from the rich. This is the doctrine of <hi>Vaſqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I now come to your own impoſtures. You in the beginning ſpeak much of the obligation which <hi>Vaſquez</hi> impoſes on <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men</hi> to be charitable.

               <p>Then you openly quarrell, that, after I had cited this maxime of <hi>Vaſquez, It will be hard to find among thoſe that are worldly minded, no not among Kings any that have ought ſuperfluous,</hi> I thence conclude <hi>that rich men are hardly to give almes out of their ſuperfluity.</hi> But what do you mean, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? If it be true that the rich never have any thing almoſt ſuperfluous, does it not follow that they ſhall never almoſt ſtand oblig'd to give almes out of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity? I ſhould put it into an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in forme, if <hi>Diana,</hi> who hath ſuch an eſteeme for <hi>Vaſquez</hi> that he cals him the <hi>Phoenix of wits,</hi> had not from the ſame principle drawn the ſame conſequence. For having cited this maxime of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> he concludes from it; <hi>That in the queſtion whether rich men are obliged to give almes out of their ſuperfluity, though the opinion that obliges them thereto be true, yet it would ſeldome or never happen that it ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory in point of practiſe.</hi> I have onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd that diſcourſe word for word.

               <p>But above all, you make a great account of what you ſay, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> hath, in requitall, obliged the rich to give almes <hi>out of their neceſſary.</hi> But you have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to alledge the many conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to form this obligation, and you ſay, in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115411:154"/> generall, that he obliges the rich to give away even what is neceſſary for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This is to be too charitable, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the rule of the Goſpel is not ſo ſtrict, that were another errour, which <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is very far from. To diſguiſe his remiſſeneſſe you attribute to him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Severity, which would make him the more blameable, and conſequently you loſe the credit of citing him faithfully. But he is not worthy that reproch, after he had maintain'd, as he hath done, that the rich are not oblig'd either out of juſtice or charity to give of their ſuperfluity, much leſſe out of their neceſſary, in all the ordinary exigences of the poor, and that they are not oblig'd to give out of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but upon occaſions ſuch as ſeldome or never happen.</p>
               <p>This is all you lay to my charge, ſo that I have now no more to do but to make appeare how falſe that pretence of yours is, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is more ſevere then <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> And this is not hard to do, ſince that that Cardinall teaches, <hi>That a man is in point of justice, oblig'd to give almes out of his ſuperfluity even in the ordinary neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the poor; becauſe, according to the holy Fathers, the rich are onely ſtewards as
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115411:154"/> to what they have ſuperfluous, having onely the liberty to bestow it on whom they pleaſe of thoſe that are in want.</hi> So that whereas <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> ſayes of the maximes of <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> that <hi>they are extremely convenient, and very acceptable to the rich, and their Confeſſours, this Cardinall,</hi> who hath no ſuch comfort to give them, declares, <hi>de Eleem. c.</hi> 6. <hi>That there needs no more be ſaid to the rich then theſe words of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>that it is eaſier for a Camel to paſſe through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdome of Heaven; and to their Confeſſours, then this ſaying of the ſame Saviour, if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch.</hi> So indiſpenſable did he think this obligation! And indeed it is no more then what the Fathers and all the Saints have eſtabliſh'd as an unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth. <hi>There are two caſes,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> 2.2. <hi>q</hi> 118. <hi>a.</hi> 4. <hi>wherein a man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to give almes, in point of juſtice, ex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito legali; one when the poor are in danger, the other when we have what is ſuperfluous.</hi> And <hi>q.</hi> 87. <hi>a.</hi> 1. <hi>The third tenths which the Jewes were oblig'd to eate with the poor have been augmen ed under the new Law, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>cauſe it is the pleaſure of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>that we ſhould beſtow on the poor, not onely a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115411:155"/> tenth part, but whatever we have that is ſupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fluous.</hi> And yet <hi>Vaſquez</hi> is not pleaſ'd they ſhould have ſo much as one part, ſo great complyance hath he for the rich, ſo much cruelty for the poor, and ſo oppoſite is he to thoſe ſentiments of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which makes the truth of thoſe words of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> very harſh indeed to the rich of this world, to be ſubmitted unto and embraced; <hi>When we give the poor what is neceſſary for them, we do not ſo much give them what is ours, as reſtore them what is theirs; and it is a duty in point of juſtice, rather then a work of mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus do the Saints perſwade the rich to divide with the poor the goods of the earth, if they would enjoy with them thoſe of heaven. And where you make it your buſineſſe to encourage men into ambition, whereby they have not any thing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and covetouſneſſe, which denyes to give though they had; the Saints, on the contrary, have made it theirs to engage men to give away that which is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to perſwade them that they ſhall have much if they meaſure it not by avarice that knowes no limits, but by Piety which is ingenious in finding out wayes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it ſelf, that ſo it may have the more

               </p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad, Fathers, that what I now ſay, might ſerve, not onely to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy me, that were no great matter but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to make you ſenſible of, and abhorre what is corrupt in the maximes of your <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> that ſo we may be ſincerely united in the holy precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, according to which we all ought to be judged.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond point, concerning <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> before I come to anſwer the reproches you caſt at me, I ſhall cleare up your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon this ſubject. Being ſomewhat at a loſſe what to do between the Canons of the Church, which impoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary puniſhments on <hi>Simoniſts,</hi> and the avarice of ſo many perſons as drive that infamous trade, you have been guided by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115411:156"/> your ordinary method, which is, to allow men what they deſire, and to give God words and apparences. For what can Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſts deſire more then to have money for the Benefices they have to diſpoſe? And this is that which you have exempted from Simony. But becauſe the name of <hi>Simony</hi> muſt not be loſt, and that there muſt be ſome ſubject to which it ſhould ſtick, you have choſen for that an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Idea,</hi> which never comes into the heads of the Simoniſts, and which ſhould be of no advantage to them, which is, to eſteem the money conſidered in it ſelf as much as the ſpiritual good conſidered in it ſelf. For who would ever make it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to compare things ſo diſproportionate and heterogeneal? And yet, provided a man do not make this metaphyſical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, he may beſtow his benefice on another, and receive money for it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Simony, according to your Authors.</p>
               <p>Thus do you make ſport with Religion, to comply with mens paſſions; and yet do but ſee with what gravity your Father <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi> is delivered of his dreaming imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, in the place cited in my Letters, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>disp.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 2044. <hi>A tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good may be given for a ſpiritual two

If therefore the temporal good be demanded,</hi> ſi petatur temporale, <hi>not as the price, but as the motive determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man to confer, there is no Simony at all, though he look on the poſſeſſion of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good as his end and principal expectation.

Take his own words. <hi>If a man gives a temporal good for a spiritual, not as the</hi> PRICE <hi>but the</hi> MOTIVE <hi>inclining the other to confer it, or by way of gratitude if a man had received it before, is it Simony or not?

               </p>
               <p>This, Fathers, is your doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Simony taught by your beſt Authors, who ſecond one another in it very exactly. All I have now to do is to anſwer your impoſtures. You have not ſaid any thing upon the opinion of <hi>Valentia;</hi> and ſo his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115411:157"/> doctrine ſtands good notwithſtanding your anſwer. But you faſten on that of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus,</hi> and ſay, that he hath onely deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it not to be Simony, as to divine right: And you would make people believe, that I have left out of that paſſage the words, <hi>as to divine right.</hi> What unreaſonable men are theſe! the words, <hi>as to divine right,</hi> never were in that paſſage. To this you add, that <hi>Tannerus</hi> declares it to be Simony as to <hi>poſitive right.</hi> You are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Fathers; he hath not ſaid it generally, but in ſome particular caſes, <hi>in caſibus à jure expreſſis,</hi> as he affirmes in that very place. Wherein he makes an exception as to what he had eſtabliſhed in general in that paſſage, that it is not Simony in point of conſcience; which certainly muſt needs imply, that it is not any as to poſitive right, unleſs you would make <hi>Tannerus</hi> impious to that degree as to maintain that Simony as to poſitive right, <hi>is not Simony in point of conſcience.</hi> But it is your deſign to muſter together theſe termes of <hi>divine right, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive right, natural right, the interiour and exteriour tribunal, particular caſes in the civil Law, external preſumption,</hi> and the like, ſuch as are not very much known, ſo baſely to ſhift away and to ſet people
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115411:158"/> at a loſs of your extravagances. But, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, you ſhall not ſcape through theſe triviall ſubtilties, for I ſhall put ſuch plain queſtions to you that there ſhall be no need of a <hi>diſting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o.</hi> I ask you, without medling with <hi>divine right,</hi> or <hi>the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the exteriour Tribunal,</hi> whether a Patron ſhall be a Simoniſt according to your Authors, if he diſpoſe of a Living of four hundred pound a year, and receive therefore a thouſand pound paid in hand, not as the price of the Living, but as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inclining him to diſpoſe of it. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer clearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fathers, what muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this caſe according to your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors? Will not <hi>Tannerus</hi> formally affirm, <hi>That it is no Simony in point of conſcience; ſince the temporal good is not the price of the Benefice, but onely the motive which obliges the other to beſtow it? Valentia,</hi> your The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Caen, Sanchez,</hi> and <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> will not they decide in like manner, <hi>that it is not S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mony</hi> for the ſame reaſon? Need there any more to clear this Patron from Simony, or will you dare treat him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in your Confeſſion-ſeats, what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſoever you may have of him your ſelves, ſince he hath a right to oblige you thereto, as having acted ſuitably to the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115411:158"/> advice of ſo many <hi>grave</hi> Doctors? Be then ingenuous and confeſs, that ſuch a Patron is free from Simony according to you: and when you have done, defend that doctrine if you can.</p>
               <p>This, Fathers, is the onely way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel queſtions, and to avoid the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of School-termes, or altering the ſtate of the queſtion as you do in your laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, in this manner. <hi>Tannerus,</hi> ſay you, declares at leaſt, that ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is a great <hi>ſin;</hi> and you charge me to have maliciouſly ſmothered that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>which abſolutely juſtifies him,</hi> as you pretend. But you are much miſtaken, and that many wayes. For though what you ſay were true, it were nothing, ſince that in the place where I ſpoke of it, the queſtion was not whether there were any <hi>ſin</hi> in it, but onely whether it were <hi>Simony.</hi> Now theſe are two different queſtions; Sins, according to your Maximes, oblige onely to Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſion, Simony obliges to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: and there are thoſe in the world who would think there were a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between theſe two. For you have found out expedients to make Confeſſion very eaſie, whereas you have not found out any to make Reſtitution pleaſant. I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115411:159"/> may add to this, that the caſe which <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus</hi> charges with ſin, is not ſimply that wherein a ſpiritual good is given for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which is the motive of it, and that the principal one, but he adds further, that the temporal be valued above the ſpiritual, which is that imaginary caſe we have ſpoken of already. Nor indeed is it ill done of him to charge that man with ſin, ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he muſt needs be tranſcendently wicked or very ſtupid, not to be willing to take ſuch an eaſie courſe to avoid a ſin as that of forbearing compariſons between the prices of thoſe two things, when it is lawful to give the one for the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Valentia,</hi> examining, in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this I am not ſufficiently ſatisfied of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince, your Father <hi>Eradus Billus,</hi> Profeſſor of the caſes of Conſcience at <hi>Caen,</hi> hath decided that there is not any ſin at all in it: for probable opinions are ever <hi>ripening.</hi> This is it he declares in his writings of the year 1644. againſt which
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115411:159"/> Monſieur <hi>Du Pré,</hi> Doctor and Profeſſor at <hi>Caen</hi> made that excellent printed Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſo generally known. For though this Father <hi>Eradus Billus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that the doctrine of <hi>Valentia</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Father <hi>Milha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You ſee then Fathers, that, according to all theſe Maximes, <hi>Simony</hi> would be ſo rare a thing, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himſelf would not be guilty of it, who deſirous to buy the holy Ghoſt, became thereby the image of the Simoniſts that buy; nor <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving money for a miracle, is the figure
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115411:160"/> of the Simoniſts that ſell. For it is certain, that <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when be <hi>offered the Apoſtles money to get the power to do as they did,</hi> uſed no termes of buying or ſelling, or price, and that he did onely offer his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as a motive to obtain that ſpiritual good. Which action being not ſubject to Simony according to your Authors, he might very well have eſcaped the Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> had he but known their Maximes. Nor was this ignorance leſs prejudicial to <hi>Gehazi,</hi> when he was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Leproſie by <hi>Elizeus;</hi> for, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the money of that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly healed Prince, onely by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and not as a price equal to the divine virtue whereby that miracle was wrought, he might have oblig'd the Prophet to reſtore him to his health alſo upon pain of mortal ſin; ſince ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding would have been ſuitable to the tenents of ſo many <hi>grave</hi> Doctors, and that your Confeſſors are oblig'd to abſolve their penitents in the like caſe, and to cleanſe them from their ſpiritual Leproſie, whereof the corporal is but the Figure.</p>
               <p>To be ſerious, Fathers, here's matter enough to make you ridiculous; I know not whence it comes that you hazard your
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115411:160"/> reputation thus. For I need onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your other Maximes; as this of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobar, in the practiſe of Simony according to the Society of Jeſus. When tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Then that, Fathers, there cannot be any thing more abſurd. You treat me as an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> upon occaſion of an opinion of <hi>Leſſius,</hi> which I have not cited my ſelf, but is alledg'd by <hi>Eſcobar</hi> in a paſſage I cite out of him; and ſo, were it true that <hi>Leſſius</hi> is not of the opinion attributed to him by <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> what greater injuſtice can there
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115411:161"/> be then to quarrel at me for it? When I cite <hi>Leſſius</hi> and your other Authors my ſelf, I am content to be accomptable. But ſince <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> hath ſhuffled together the opinions of twenty four of your Fathers, I would fain know whether I ought to be reſponſible any further then for what I cite out of him, or that I am moreover to give an account of the citations which he himſelf makes in the paſſages I take out of him? 'Twere ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to expect it. Now this is it that at preſent is in debate. I have cited in my Letter this paſſage of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> faithfully rendred, ſo as you object nothing againſt it. <hi>May he who turns Bankrupt, with a ſafe conſcience, retain as much of his own goods as is requiſite to maintain himſelf handſomely,</hi> nè indecorè vivat? I, WITH LESSIUS, AFFIRME, HE MAY: CUM LESSIO ASSERO POSSE, &amp;c. Hereupon you tell me that <hi>Leſſius</hi> is not of that opinion. But conſider a little how you are enſnared. For if it be true that he is, you will be called <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> for affirming the contrary; if it be not, <hi>Eſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> is the Impoſtor; ſo that it muſt needs follow that ſome one of the Society is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of impoſture. Look you to the ſcandal of it. You cannot it ſeemes foreſee the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115411:161"/> conſequences of things. You think there's no more to be done then to fill the world with reproches, without any care where they fall. Why did you not propoſe the difficulty to <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> before you publiſhed it? he might have given you ſatisfaction. But it is not ſo eaſie a matter to hear out of <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> where he is, in very good health, and upon finiſhing his grand work of MORAL DIVINITY in <hi>ſix</hi> volumes, on the former whereof I ſhall have one day ſomething to ſay to you. The firſt ten LETTERS have been ſent him; you may alſo ſend him your Objection, and I am confident he would have given a good account of it, for, no queſtion he hath ſeen that paſſage in <hi>Leſsius</hi> whence he hath taken the <hi>nè indicorè vivat.</hi> You would do well, Fathers, to read him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and you will find it in him as well as I, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 45. <hi>Idem colligitur apertè ex juribus citatis, maximè quoad ea bona quae poſt ceſſionem acquirit, de quibus is qui debitor eſt, etiam ex delicto, poteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere quan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to ſhew you that <hi>Leſſius,</hi> to authoriſe this Maxime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the Law, which allows Bankrupts onely a ſimple livelihood and not an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſubſiſtence; Its enough that I have clear'd <hi>Eſcobar</hi> from ſo unjuſt an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation; 'Tis more then I was oblig'd to do. But you, Fathers, for your parts, have not done what you ſhould: for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to anſwer the paſſage of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> whoſe deciſions are very convenient and of great advantage, in that not depending on either what went before, or relating to what comes after, but being confin'd by little articles, they are not ſubject to your diſtinctions. I have cited that whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of him, wherein he allows thoſe that turn Bankrupts, to retain ſo much of their eſtates, though unjuſtly gotten, as whereby they may maintain their families handſomly. Which gave me occaſion to cry out in my Letters; <hi>How, Fathers, by what ſtrange kind of charity would you have thoſe goods remain in their hands who came unjuſtly thereby, rather then return to the lawful Owners and Creditors?</hi> This is it you are to anſwer to; but it is a thing puts you to ſuch a loſs, that you vainly endeavour to elude it by ſhifting off the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115411:162"/> queſtion, and citing other paſſages of <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> not at all relating to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. I therefore ask you whether this maxime of <hi>Eſcobar</hi> may, in point of conſcience, be followed by thoſe who turn bankrupts; and take good heed what you ſay. For if you anſwer, they may nor, what will become of your Doctor, and the doctrine of <hi>Probability?</hi> if you ſay they may, I refer you to the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I leave you with the Wolfe by the ears; for I cannot for want of place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with the enſuing impoſture upon the paſſage of <hi>Leſſius</hi> concerning <hi>Homicide;</hi> I leave it to the next opportunity, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>In the interim, I ſhall ſay nothing to you concerning the ADVERTISEMENTS full of ſcandalous forgeries, wherewith you conclude every impoſture: I ſhall anſwer all together in the Letter wherein I hope to diſcover the firſt elements of all your calumnies. I am ſorry, Fathers, you ſhould be forc'd to ſuch remedies. The reproches you caſt upon me will not clear up the differences between us, and the threats you are ſo liberal of ſhal not hinder me from vindicating my ſelf. You think you have <hi>might</hi> and <hi>impunity</hi> of your ſide,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115411:163"/> and I think I have <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>innocence</hi> on mine. 'Tis a ſtrange and long war where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in violence endeavours to oppoſe Truth. All the attempts of violence cannot ſo much as weaken truth, nay they as much as may be ſtrengthen her. All the luſtre of truth is ſo far from appeaſing violence, that it does but more and more exaſperate it. When might is engag'd with might, the ſtronger power ſwallows up the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; but when diſcourſes are oppoſ'd one to another, thoſe that are true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive confound and defeat thoſe which have nothing in them but vanity and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: but violence and truth can prevail nothing one upon another. Yet let it not be thence preſum'd that things are equall: for there is this main difference, that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is limited by the order of God, who diſpoſes the effects of it to the glory of that Truth which it oppoſes: whereas Truth ſubſiſts eternally, and at laſt triumphs over her enemies, becauſe ſhe is eternal and powerful as God himſelf.</p>

But what will he ſay Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when he finds at the ſame time, that in the place beforementioned he treats of a queſtion very different from that we now ſpeak of, and that the opinion, whereof he, in that place condemnes the practice, cannot any way be that now in hand, but another of a quite different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And yet to cleare up the buſineſſe, we need but open the book at the very place to which you referre us. For there you will find the ſequel of his diſcourſe in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He treats of the</hi> queſtion, <hi>whether a man may kill for a box o'th eare,</hi> in <hi>num.</hi> 79. and concludes it in <hi>num.</hi> 80. without any the leſt word of <hi>condemnation.</hi> That queſtion being decided, he opens another in article 81. viz. <hi>whether one man may kill another for opprobrious speeches.</hi> And it is upon that that he hath <hi>n.</hi> 82. the words by you cited, <hi>I condemne the practice of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not a ſhamefull thing, Fathers, that you durſt produce theſe words, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that <hi>Leſſius</hi> condemnes the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a man may be kil'd for a box o'th eare?

To make them believe that <hi>Leſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is not of ſuch on opinion, you open his book at a place where he condemnes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſo theſe perſons not diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, and not making it their buſineſſe to examine whether the queſtion contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted be treated of in that place, you baſely abuſe their credulity. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Fathers, that to avoid ſo ſhamefull a falſehood you were forc'd to fly to your doctrine of Equivocation, and that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole paſſage <hi>aloud,</hi> you ſaid <hi>to your ſelves,</hi> that ſomething elſe was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in that place.

               <p>Hinder them, Fathers, from ſeeing my LETTERS, ſince it is the onely courſe you can take to keep up your credit for a

For having publiſhed this fourth impoſture, with ſo much noiſe, you muſt needs be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited when it comes to be known that you have ſuppoſed one paſſage for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It will then be eaſily imagined that if you could have found what you look'd for in that place where <hi>Leſſius</hi> treated of that matter, you would not have ſought it elſewhere; and that you would not have made uſe of this ſhift but becauſe you could not faſten on any thing elſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd your deſign.

Who therefore can ſufficiently admire, to ſee with that confidence you produce, <hi>in terminis,</hi> the contrary to a truth in <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact?</hi> So that in ſtead of what you conclude from your ſuppoſed paſſage, that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115411:166"/> 
                  <hi>Leſſius</hi> was not of this opinion, it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be concluded from his true paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that he is of this very opinion.</p>
               <p>You would further make <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſay, <hi>that he condemnes the practiſe of it.</hi> And yet, as I have already ſaid, there is not the leaſt ſyllable of <hi>condemnation</hi> in that place; but he ſayes thus; <hi>It ſeemeth that the practiſe thereof ſhould not</hi> EASILY <hi>be permitted; in praxi non videtur</hi> FACILE PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITTENDA. Is this the language of a man that <hi>condemnes</hi> a Maxime? Will you affirme, Fathers, that Adulteries and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts are not eaſily <hi>to be permitted,</hi> in the practiſe? ſhould we not on the contrary, rather inferre, that, ſince <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſayes onely that the practiſe of it is not eaſily to be allowed, it may be ſometimes allowable though but ſeldome: And as if it had been his deſign to acquaint all the world when it were allowable, and ſecure the perſons offended as to all ſcruples of conſcience they might be troubled with in caſe they knew not on what occaſions it were not lawfull for them to kill, in the practiſe, he hath taken the paines to give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what they ſhould avoid, to practiſe this doctrine conſcienciouſly. Mind him, Fathers, <hi>It ſeemeth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that it ought

Would you have an inſtance Fathers? I have a freſh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All he had then to do, was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void too great a number of murthers: and you know, Fathers, that it happens ſo ſeldome that <hi>Jeſuits</hi> give boxes o'th eare to the officers of the Kings houſhold that it was not not much to be feared, that one murther committed on ſuch an occaſion might have cauſed a many others in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And ſo you cannot deny but that Jeſuit might have been kil'd with ſafety of conſcience, and that the perſon affronted might not upon that occaſion have put
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115411:167"/> the doctrine of <hi>Leſſius</hi> in practiſe. And, Fathers, he might haply have done it, had he been brought up in your School, and learned of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> that <hi>the man who hath receav'd a box o'th eare is accounted diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, till ſuch time as he hath killed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that that gave it him.</hi> But you may with ſome reaſon, imagine, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary inſtructions he receaved from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Vicar,</hi> whom you affect not too much, have not a little contributed, as to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, to the ſaving of a Jeſuits life.</p>
               <p>Let us then heare no more of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences avoidable in ſo many occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and which taken away, murther is according to <hi>Leſſius,</hi> allowable even in practick.

               <p>When you undertook to decide caſes of Conſcience in a gentle and complying way, you met with ſome wherein <hi>Religion</hi> onely was concerned, as the queſtions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>contrition, penance,</hi> the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and al thoſe that relate to the interiour of mens conſciences. But you have found others, wherein the <hi>State</hi> is concerned as well as <hi>Religion,</hi> ſuch as are thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, Homicide,</hi> and the like.

One you call that of <hi>specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> wherein, conſidering thoſe crimes in themſelves, without regarding the intereſt of the State, but onely the law of God prohibiting them, you have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble, allowed them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115411:169"/> overturned the law of God that condemned them. The other you call that of <hi>practiſe,</hi> wherein reflecting on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the State thereby, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Magiſtrates who maintain the publick ſafety, you do not alwaies allow in the practiſe thoſe murthers and crimes which you found lawfull in the ſpeculation, ſo to ſecure your ſelves as to the Judges.

                  </gap> opinions at firſt ſhoot forth under this diſtinction, by means whereof you ruine onely Religion, without doing any viſible injury to the State. Thus do you think your ſelves in a ſecure poſture: For you imagine that the eſteem you have in the Church will keep men from puniſhing your attempts againſt truth, and that the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115411:169"/> caution you uſe in not allowing what you think lawfull to be put in practiſe, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you as to the Magiſtrates, who not being judges of caſes of Conſcience, are not properly to meddle with any thing but the externall practiſe. Thus an opinion which were condemnable under the name of practiſe, is ſecurely advanced under that of ſpeculation. Now this foundation being well laid, it is no hard matter to build up your other maximes upon it. There was an infinite diſtance between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition which God made to kill, and the ſpeculative permiſſion which your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have given to do it. But the diſtance between this permiſſion and the practiſe is not very great. All then you have to do is to ſhew, that what is allowable in the ſpeculative is alſo in the practiſe. To do this, you cannot want reaſons; you have been furniſhed in caſes of much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. Would you ſee Fathers how it may be attained? Follow this ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Eſcobar,</hi> who hath clearly decided it, in the firſt of the <hi>ſixe</hi> Tomes of his grand <hi>Morall Divinity,</hi> which I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where he is otherwiſe illuminated then he was in the collection he made of your 24. Ancients. For whereas he
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115411:170"/> thought at that time there might be opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions probable in the ſpeculative, which yet were not ſecure in the practice, he hath ſince found out the contrary, and hath eſtabliſhed it in this laſt work of his; ſo ſtrangely is the doctrine of Probability cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by time, as well as every probable opinion in particular. Heare himſelf, in <hi>praeloq. n.</hi> 15. <hi>I ſee not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how it ſhould be, that what ſeems allowable in the specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſhould not be ſuch in the practick, ſince that what may be done in the practick, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on what is found allowable in the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and that theſe things differ not one from another, but as the effect and the Cauſe. For speculation is that which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the action.</hi> WHENCE IT FOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVVETH, THAT A MAN MAY WITH A SAFE CONSCIENCE FOLLOVV IN THE PRACTICK THE OPINIONS THAT ARE-PROBABLE IN THE SPECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATIVE; <hi>nay, and that with more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then thoſe which a man hath not ſpeculative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, well examined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, Fathers, your <hi>Eſcobar</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons very well ſometimes. And indeed, there is ſuch an allyance between <hi>specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi> that when one hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                  <hi>cus,</hi> and hath taught, <hi>That it is lawfull</hi> ken root, you make no difficulty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the other, without ſhadowing the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe at all. This is apparent in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to kill for a box o'th eare, which from ſimple ſpeculation, hath, by <hi>Leſſius,</hi> been confidently ſtretched to a practiſe which ought <hi>not eaſily to be permitted;</hi> and thence, by <hi>Eſcobar to an eaſy practiſe;</hi> whence your Fathers of <hi>Caen</hi> have cran'd it up to an abſolute permiſſion, without any diſtinction of <hi>Theory</hi> or <hi>practiſe,</hi> as you have already ſeen.</p>
               <p>Thus do you give your opinions an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible growth. Should they of a ſudden ſhoot out into their extremities, they would cauſe horrour. But this ſlow and inſenſible progreſſe gently reconciles them to mens humours, and takes away the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of them. And by this means, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of killing, ſo odious to Church and State, is firſt introduced into the Church, and out of the Church into the State.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſucceſſe hath the opinion of killing for ill language met with, for it is now arrived to an equall permiſſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction.

               <p>I have told you already of your Father <hi>Amicus,</hi> and you are not to learne, that his doctrine on this ſubject was cenſured by the Univerſity of <hi>Lovain</hi> in the yeare 1649. And yet it is not two months ſince that your F. <hi>des Bois</hi> hath maintain'd at <hi>Roven</hi> that very cenſured doctrine of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and hath taught, <hi>That it is lawfull

               <p>What have you now to ſay, Fathers? How will you preſume to maintaine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>that no Jeſuit was ever of opinion that it was lawfull to kill for ill language?</hi> Or need we any thing elſe to convince you then the opinions which I have cited of your Fathers, ſince they forbid not to kill ſpeculatively, but onely in the practick <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the inconvenience that would thereby happen to the State?</hi> For I ask you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Fathers, whether the maine buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our diſpute be not to examine whether you have not ſubverted the law of God which forbids <hi>homicide?</hi> The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not to know whether you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the State, but Religion. What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is it to you, in this kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute to ſhew that you have had a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the State, when at the ſame time you make it appeare that you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115411:172"/> Religion, by affirming, as you do <hi>p.</hi> 28. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>That the meaning of Reginaldus, upon the question of killing for opprobrious ſpeeches, is, that a private man hath a right to uſe that kind of defence, conſidering it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ſelfe.</hi> I deſire no more then this acknowledgement to confound you. A private man, ſay you, hath a right to make uſe of this defence, that is to ſay, to kill or opprobrious language, conſidering the thing in it ſelf. And conſequently, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the law of God which forbids killing, is deſtroyed by this deciſion.</p>
               <p>Nor does what you ſay afterward make any thing, for you <hi>that it is unlawfull &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, even by the Law of God, becauſe of the murthers and diſorders which might thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happen in the State, and that men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, in relation to God, to be tender of the welfare of the State,</hi> This is to fly out of the queſtion. For, Fathers, there are two <hi>Lawes</hi> to be obſerved, one, forbidding to kill, the other, forbidding to endamage the State. <hi>Reginaldus</hi> hath not haply bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that Law which forbids to prejudice the State, but hath infallibly violated that which forbids killing. Now all the matter in queſtion is of this latter. Beſides that your other Fathers who have permitted
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115411:172"/> theſe murthers in the practiſe have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed both. To go yet a little higher. We are ſatisfyed that you do ſometimes forbid men to prejudice the State, and you affirme your deſign therein is to obſerve the law of God, obliging them to defend it. This may be true, though it be not certain; ſince you might do the ſame thing meerly out of a feare of the Magiſtrates. Let us then examine from what principle this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeds.</p>
               <p>Were it not true, Fathers, did you really look upon God, and that the obſervation of his law, were the firſt &amp; principall object of your reſolutions, that this reſpect and reverence would unanimouſly guide all your more important deciſions, and would engage you upon all occaſions to be tender of the concernments of <hi>Religion.</hi> But if, on the contrary, it be apparent that you vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, in ſo many occurrences, the moſt ſacred proviſions God had made for men, when you have nothing to oppoſe but his Law; and that even in thoſe emergencies wherein it is moſt concerned, you deſtroy that law of God which forbids theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as criminall in themſelves, and are not by any thing deterred from approving them in the practick but a feare of the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115411:173"/> Judges, do you not give us juſt cauſe to imagine, that it is not God you reflect on in that feare; and that, if, in appearance you maintain his Law, in what relates to the obligation of not prejudicing the State, it is not out of any tenderneſſe you have for his law, but to compaſſe your own ends; a method hath ever been obſerved by the moſt atheiſticall <hi>Politicians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How, Fathers, you will tell us, that there is a certain right to kill for opprobrious language, when a man reflects onely on the Law of God which forbids murther? And having thus violated the eternall law of God, you think to take away the ſcandall you had raiſed, and perſwade us you are very reſpectfull towards him, by adding that you forbid the practiſe of it upon certain conſiderations of State, and for feare of the Judges? Is not this rather to adde a new ſcandall to the other, not out of the reſpect you ſeeme to have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for the Judges; for that is not it I lay to your charge, and you are very pleaſant upon that ſtring, <hi>p.</hi> 29. I do not, I ſay, charge you with a feare of the Judges, but that you feare nothing but the Judges, and not the Judge of Judges? That is it I quarrell at, becauſe it is to make God a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115411:173"/> milder enemy to crimes then men. Had you affirmed it lawfull to kill an evil ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker according to men but not according to God, it were more ſupportable; but that that which is too offenſive to be ſuffered by men ſhould be innocent and juſt in the ſight of God who is juſtice it ſelf, what does it but diſcover to all the world, that, by this horrid confuſion of things, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſpirit of the Saints, you are grown impudent towards God, and are afraid of men? Had you been ſincerely minded to condemne theſe <hi>homicides,</hi> you would not have taken away the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God which forbids them: and if you durſt have permitted them at firſt ſight, you would have permitted them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly notwithſtanding the Lawes both of God and men. But as you would have them inſenſibly creep into permiſſion, and ſurpriſe the magiſtrates, the Sentinells of pub ick ſafety, ſo have you gone ſubtilly to work by cleaving your maximes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing on the one ſide, <hi>that it is lawfull in the speculative to kill men for opprobrious ſpeeches</hi> (for you are at liberty to examine things in ſpeculation) and producing, on the other, this maxime independently from the other, <hi>That what is lawfull in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115411:174"/> is alſo ſuch in the practick.</hi> For what concernment does the State ſeem to have in this general and metaphyſical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? And ſo theſe two principles being, as not dangerous, ſeparately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the vigilance of the Magiſtrate is eluded, ſince there needs no more then to faſten theſe Maximes together to draw from them this concluſion, which is that you would aim at, That it is allowable, in the practick, to kill onely for opprobrious ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>This indeed, Fathers, is one of the moſt ſubtile contrivances of your Politicks, to ſeparate in your writings, the Maximes which you joyn together in your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 'Twas ſo by pieces that you eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd your doctrine of <hi>Probability,</hi> which I have often inſiſted on. And this general principle being laid as a corner-ſtone, you ſeparately advance ſuch things, as being innocent in themſelves, yet become hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid joyn'd to that pernicious principle. I ſhall onely inſtance in what you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. in your impoſtures, and which I am oblig'd to make ſome anſwer to, <hi>viz. That many famous Divines are of opinion, that one may kill another for a box o'th' ear given.</hi> Certain it is, Fathers, that if a perſon
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115411:174"/> that did not maintain Probability had ſaid it, there were nothing to be quarrelled at, ſince it were onely to make a ſimple reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal that ſhould have no conſequence. But for you, Fathers, and all thoſe that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that dangerous doctrine, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is approv'd by eminent Authors, is probable and ſure in point of conſcience, when you add thereto that many famous Authors are of opinion that it is lawfull to kill for a box o'th' ear, what do you but put ſtilletto's into the hands of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to kill thoſe ſhall offend them, aſſuring them that they may do it with ſafty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; becauſe they ſhall therein follow the opinions of ſo many <hi>grave</hi> Authors?</p>
               <p>What horrid language is this, which, while it affirms that ſome Authors hold a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, is at the ſame time a deciſion in favour of that damnable opinion, &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes in conſcience whatever it does but cite! It is underſtood, Fathers, to be the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of your School. And it is a thing to be ſtartled at, that you have the face and confidence to ſpeak ſo loud, ſince it viſibly diſcovers your judgment, and is a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that you hold this opinion, <hi>that it is lawful to kill for a box o'th' ear,</hi> to be ſure in point of conſcience, as ſoon
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115411:175"/> as you had told us, that many famous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors maintain'd it.</p>
               <p>You cannot ſhift it off, Fathers, no more then you can make your advantage of the paſſages of <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> which you object to me, wherein they condemn theſe murthers which their Brethren approve. Theſe teſtimonies ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from the reſt of your doctrine might dazle their apprehenſions who are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently skilled therein. But we might joyn your principles and Maximes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. You ſay here that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> does not permit theſe murthers; but what will you ſay on the other ſide, Fathers? <hi>That the probability of one opinion hinders not the probability of another opinion contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> And in another place, <hi>That it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to follow the leſs probable and leſs ſecure op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115411:175"/> Maximes into one body which you for your juſtification, ſuffer to ſtraggle up and down. To what end therefore do you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe paſſages of your Fathers, which I have not cited, to mitigate thoſe which I have, ſince there is nothing common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? What priviledge does this give you to call me an <hi>impoſtor?</hi> Have I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that all your Fathers are in the ſame degree of degeneration? Nay have I not, on the contrary, made it appear, that your main deſign requires you ſhould have ſome of all opinions, to be made uſe of on all occaſions? To thoſe who are inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to murther, you will recommend <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> to thoſe that are not, you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Vaſquez;</hi> that ſo none be diſmiſt, diſ-ſatisfied, and without having of his ſide a <hi>grave</hi> Author. <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſhall ſpeak of <hi>Homicide</hi> like a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and haply, of <hi>almes</hi> ſomewhat like a <hi>Christian; Vaſquez</hi> ſhall ſpeak of almes like a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and of murther like a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Probability</hi> which <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Leſſius</hi> joyntly maintain, and which renders all opinions common and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, they will reciprocally lend one the other their ſentiments, and will be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to abſolve thoſe who ſhall have acted
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115411:176"/> according to the opinions which either of them condemns. It is therefore this varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that augments your diſorder. Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie were much more tolerable, and there is nothing ſo contrary to the expreſs rules of Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> and your firſt <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> as this endleſs confuſion of all ſorts of opinions. I ſhall one day have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for you about it; and it will be matter of aſtoniſhment to ſee how you are fallen from the firſt ſpirit of your inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that your own Generals have foreſeen, that the extravagance of your doctrine in point of Morality, might prove fatal, not onely to your Society, but to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, take it from me, you ſhall not make any advantage of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> It were a miraculous thing, if among ſo many <hi>Jeſuits</hi> as have written, there were not one or two that ſhould affirm what all Chriſtians acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There's no great reputation in maintaining that it is not lawful to kill for a box o'th' ear, according to the Goſpel; but it is an horrid ſhame to deny it. So that this contributes ſo little to your juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that there's nothing makes more againſt you, ſince that having had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115411:176"/> you ſuch Doctors as have told you the truth, you have not remained in the truth, and have loved the darkneſs better then the light. For you have learn'd of <hi>Vaſquez, That it is a Pagan, and not a Chriſtian opinion, to affirme that a man may give a blow with a ſtick to him who had given him a box o'th' ear. That it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Decalogue and the Goſpel, to affirm that one man may kill another upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that the lewdeſt villaines that have any thing of man-kind in them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as much.</hi> And yet, contrarie to theſe truths, you have ſuffer'd <hi>Leſſius, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobar,</hi> and the reſt, to decide, That all the prohibitions which God hath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Homicide, hinder not but that a man may be kill'd for a box o'th' ear. To what end was it that that paſſage of <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> was brought in to confront the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Leſsius,</hi> unleſs it be to ſhew that <hi>Leſsius</hi> is a <hi>Pagan and a Villaine</hi> according to <hi>Vaſquez?</hi> and that is more then I durſt have ſaid. What concluſion then can we make hence, but that <hi>Leſsius deſtroys the Decalogue and the Gospel?</hi> That at the laſt day <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſhall condemn <hi>Leſsius</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point, as <hi>Leſsius</hi> ſhall condemn <hi>Vaſquez</hi> upon another; and that all your

               <p>Conclude we then, Fathers, that, ſince your probabilitie makes the good opinions of ſome of your Authors unſerviceable to the Church, and advantageous onely to your ſelves in point of Policy, all they do, is, by their contradictions, to diſcover the doubleneſs of your hearts, which you have clearly demonſtrated by aſſuring us, of the one ſide, that <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> are of contrary opinions upon the point of <hi>Homicide;</hi> and of the other, that many eminent Authors are for Homicide, ſo to put men into two ſeveral wayes; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the ſimplicitie of the ſpirit of God, who hath a curſe reſerved for the double-hearted, and thoſe that halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two wayes. <hi>Vae duplici cords, &amp; ingredienti duabus viis.</hi>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115411:178"/> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>common-ſence.</hi> For what can be more natural then this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That one private perſon hath no right over the life of another? We are ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed of our ſelves,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, as that when God laid down the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of not killing, he hath not added, that it is becauſe Homicide is an evil; but becauſe,</hi> ſayes this Father, <hi>that the Law ſuppoſes that men had already learned that truth of Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that men have at all times been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this commandment: the Goſpel hath confirm'd that of the Law, and the Decalogue did onely renew what men had receiv'd from God before the Law, in the perſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> of whom all men were to ſpring. For upon that reſtauration of the World, God ſaid to this Patriarch; <hi>And at the hand of man, even at the hands of a mans brother will I require the life of man. Who ſo ſheddeth mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed, for in the image of God hath he made man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this general prohibition are men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all power over the lives of men. And God hath ſo far reſerved it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, according to Chriſtian Truth, oppoſite in this to the falſe Maximes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115411:178"/> a man hath not indeed any power over his own life. But in regard that his providence thought fit to take ſome courſe to preſerve the Societies of men, and to puniſh the wicked that ſhould diſturbe them, he hath himſelf eſtabliſhed certaine Laws, to deprive guilty perſons of their lives: and ſo thoſe murthers, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his order, were attempts liable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, become, by his order commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable chaſtiſements, which taken away there is nothing but what is unjuſt therein. Thus much hath been excellently well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his firſt book of the City of God, <hi>ch.</hi> 21. <hi>God himſelf,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath made certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in this general prohibition of killing, either by the Laws, which he hath eſtabliſh'd for the putting to death of guilty perſons, or by the particular orders he hath ſometimes given to put to death ſome certain perſons. So that when men kill in that caſe, it is not man that kills, but God, of whom man is onely the inſtrument, as a ſword in the hand of him that makes uſe of it. But theſe caſes excepted, who ever kills is guilty of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is then out of all queſtion, Fathers, that God onely hath the power to take
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115411:179"/> away life, and that nevertheleſs having eſtabliſh'd Laws to put the guilty to death, he hath made Kings and Republicks the Guardians of this power. And this is taught us by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when ſpeaking of the right which Supreme Authorities have to put men to death, he derives it from heaven, ſaying, <hi>That they carry not the ſword in vain, as being the Ministers of God to execute vengeance upon the evil-doers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as they derive this power from God, ſo does he oblige them to exerciſe it as God himſelf would, that is to ſay, with juſtice, according to this ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>For Magiſtrates are not to be feared for good works but for evil. Wilt thou then be without fear of the power? do well; ſo ſhalt thou have the praiſe of the ſame. For they are the Miniſters of God for good.</hi> And this reſtriction is ſo far from abating any thing of this power, that, on the contrary, it extremely heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it, becauſe it is to make it like that of God, who is impotent as to the doing of evil, and omnipotent as to the doing of good, as alſo to diſtinguiſh it from that of Devils, who are impotent as to the doing of good, and whoſe power is onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in evil. There is onely this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115411:179"/> between God and Soveraigns, that God being Juſtice and Wiſdome it ſelf, he may without any ceremonies put to death whom he pleaſes, and that when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and after what manner he pleaſes. For beſides that he is the ſoveraigne diſpoſer of mens lives, he cannot take them away either without cauſe or cognizance, ſince he is as incapable of injuſtice as of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. But Princes are not to proceed ſo, becauſe they are not ſo the Miniſters of God, but that they are ſtill men and not Gods. They may be ſurpriz'd by evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; they may be exaſperated by falſe ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; they may be tranſported by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and this is it hath engag'd them to lay down certain humane proviſions, &amp; in their Dominions to eſtabliſh Judges, to whom they have communicated that power, that ſo the authority which God hath inveſted them with, might not be employed but to the end for which they had receiv'd it.</p>
               <p>You are then to conceive, Fathers, that to be exempted from Homicide, a man muſt act both by the authority of God and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the juſtice of God; and if theſe two conditions meet not together, a man offends either by killing with his Authority but without his juſtice, or by killing with
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115411:180"/> his juſtice but without his Authority. From the neceſſity of this union, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, according to Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>he who without authority kills a guilty perſon becomes guilty himſelf, for this reaſon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally that he uſurpes an Authority which God had not given him;</hi> and, on the contrary, the Judges, who have this Authority, are nevertheleſſe <hi>homicides,</hi> if they put to death an innocent perſon, contrary to the lawes they ought to have obſerved.</p>
               <p>Theſe, Fathers, are the principles of publick ſafety and tranquility, which have been received through all times and in all places, and upon which all Law-givers, as well-ſacred, as profane, have eſtabliſhed their Lawes; inſomuch that even Pagans have made no exception to this rule, unleſs it ſo happened that there were no other way to avoid the loſſe of chaſtity or life, as conceiving that as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Lawes themſelves ſeemed to offer their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to thoſe that are in ſuch an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>

               <p>But, this caſe excepted, which yet I have nothing to ſay to in this place, that there ever was any Law that permitted private perſons to kill, or hath ſuffered it, as you do, to put off an affront and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115411:180"/> the loſſe of honour or eſtate, when a man is not at the ſame time in any danger of his life, is a thing, Fathers, which I maintain was never done even by Infidels. Nay on the contrary, they have expreſſely forbidden it. It was one of the Lawes of the 12. Tables at <hi>Rome, That it was not lawfull to kill a Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, forbids the killing of Theeves even in the night time, if they put us not in danger of our lives.</hi> See it in <hi>Cujacius,</hi> in <hi>tit. dig. de. Juſtit. &amp; jure ad l.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Tell us now, Fathers, by what authority you permit what both divine and humane Lawes prohibit, and by what priviledge <hi>Leſſius</hi> could ſay, <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>num.</hi> 66. and 72. <hi>it is, in Exodus prohibited to kill Theeves in the day time, who defend not themſelves by force of armes, and they are puniſhable by the hand of juſtice that ſhould kill in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And yet all this would not make a man guilty in point of conſcience, when a man is not certain that he ſhall be able to recover what is taken from him, or that he doubt it, as

The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> puniſhes thoſe that kill Theeves when they do not attempt our lives, and the Law of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> according to you, ſhall abſolve them? How, Fathers, is JESUS CHRIST come to deſtroy the Law, and not to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it? <hi>the Judges,</hi> ſaith <hi>Leſſius, would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe that ſhould kill upon ſuch an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet a man were not guilty in point of conſcience.</hi> Is it that the Morality of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST is more cruell and leſſe an enemy to murther then that of Pagans, out of which the Judges have taken thoſe civil Lawes that condemne it? Do Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians make a greater account of the things of this world, or leſſe of men lives, then Idolaters and Infidels have done? What ground do you take for this Fathers? Not any expreſſe Law either of God or men; but onely this extravagant way of diſcourſe. <hi>The Lawes,</hi> you ſay, <hi>permit a man to defend himſelf against theeves, and to oppoſe force with force. Now this defence once permitted, murther muſt alſo be thought permitted, ſince that without it it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>It is falſe, Fathers, this defence being permitted, that Murther is alſo permitted. 'Tis this cruell way of defending ones ſelfe is the ſpring of all your Errours, and which is called by the facu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whence then doe you derive the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to affirme, as <hi>Molina, Reginaldus, Filiutius, Eſcobar, Leſſius,</hi> and others doe, <hi>That it is lawfull to kill him that comes to ſtrike us;</hi> and elſewhere. <hi>It is lawfull to kill
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115411:182"/> him that comes to affront us, according to the judgement of all Caſuiſts, ex ſententia omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> as <hi>Leſſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>num.</hi> 74? By what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do you who are but private men, communicate this power to other private men, nay to Religious men? And how dare you preſume to uſurpe this right of life and death, which belongs eſſentially onely to God, and is the moſt glorious character of a ſupreme power? This you ſhould have anſwered; and you think you have done us abundance of right, by ſaying ſimply in your 13. Impoſture, <hi>That the valuable conſideration for which Molina permits a man to kill a theef who runs away without doing us any violence, is not ſo ſmall as I ſaid it was, &amp; that it is requiſite it ſhould be greater then of ſix Duckets.</hi> What pitifull ſtuffe is this, Fathers, where would you determine it? At 15. or 16 Duckets? I ſhall have the ſame reproch for you.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115411:182"/> as you cannot but ſtand to: I choſe to that end your Father <hi>Reginaldus,</hi> who explaining that very place of <hi>Molina, l.</hi> 21. <hi>num.</hi> 68. declares, <hi>that Molina there</hi> DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERMINES <hi>the value for which it is not lawfull to kill, at</hi> 3. <hi>or</hi> 4. <hi>or</hi> 5. <hi>duckets.</hi> And ſo Fathers, I ſhall not have onely <hi>Molina</hi> but alſo <hi>Reginaldus</hi> on my ſide.</p>
               <p>I ſhall find no harder taske to refute your 14. impoſture touching the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>to kill a Theef who would rob us of a Crown</hi> according to <hi>Molina.</hi> This is ſo cleare, that <hi>Eſcobar</hi> ſhall be my witneſſe for it, <hi>tr.</hi> 1. <hi>ex.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 44. where he ſayes that <hi>Molina doth regularly determine the value for which a man may be killed, at a Crown.</hi> And all you have to lay to my charge, in the 14. impoſture is that I have ſuppreſſ'd the laſt words of that paſſage, viz: <hi>that men ought to obſerve herein the moderation of a juſt defence.</hi> Why do you not alſo quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell at <hi>Eſcobar</hi> for not having expreſſed them? But how pitifully ſubtile you are? you think men underſtand not what it is, according to you, for a man to defend himſelf. Do we not know that it is to make uſe of a <hi>murthering defence?</hi> You would perſwade us that <hi>Molina's</hi> meaning in it is, that when a man is in danger of his
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115411:183"/> life by keeping his crown, then he may kil, ſince it is in his own defence. Were this true, Fathers, why ſhould <hi>Molina</hi> ſay in the ſame place, That, in that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Carrerus</hi> and <hi>Pald</hi> who permit killing in ones own defence? Take it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from me, that he ſimply means, that, if a man can keep his crown without kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the theef, he ought not to kill him; but that if he cannot ſecure it but by killing him, though he run no hazard in point of life, as in caſe the Theef have no armes, it is lawfull to arme againſt him and to kill him, to ſecure the crown; and that ſo doing, a man does not, according to him, exceed the moderation of a juſt defence.

               </p>
               <p>Thus, Fathers, have I made it apparent, that your Authors permit killing for the defence of a mans eſtate and his honour, though he be not in the leaſt danger of life.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115411:183"/> From this principle do they authoriſe Duells, as I have diſcovered by ſo many paſſages, to which you have made no anſwer at all. You meddle not in your writings, but with one ſingle paſſage of your F. <hi>Lay-man</hi> who permits it, <hi>in caſe a man were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in danger to loſe his fortune or his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> and ſay, that I have ſuppreſſed what he addes, that <hi>that happens very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> O how I admire you Fathers; theſe indeed are excellent impoſtures that you charge me with! It is indeed a queſtion, to know whether this caſe happen ſo ſeldome? But what we have under conſideration is whether it be lawfull to fight a duell in ſuch a caſe. Theſe are two different que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. <hi>Lay-man,</hi> in the quality of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt is to judge whether duelling be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and he declares for the affirmative. We can without him, be our own judges whether that caſe happen ſeldome, and ſhall tell him, that <hi>it is very ordinary.</hi> And if you will take your good friend <hi>Diana's</hi> word for it, he will tell you it is <hi>very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, part.</hi> 5. <hi>tr.</hi> 14. <hi>Miſc.</hi> 2, <hi>Reſol.</hi> 99. But whether it happen ſeldome or not, and that <hi>Lay-man</hi> follow therein <hi>Navarrus,</hi> as you will needs have us believe, is it not an abominable thing that he ſhould conſent
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115411:184"/> to that opinion; that to preſerve an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain reputation, it is lawfull in point of Conſcience to accept a challenge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Acts and Edicts of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States, and againſt all the Canons of the Church, though you have not, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe all theſe diabolicall Maximes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes, or Canons, or authorities of Scripture or Fathers, or the example of any one Saint, but onely this impious rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination; <hi>Honour is more precious then life; But it is lawfull for one man to kill another in defence of his life; it is therefore lawfull to kill in defence of a mans honour.</hi> How, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe mankind is ſo degenerated, as to love his counterfeit honour more then the lives which God hath given them to ſerve him in, it ſhall be lawfull for them to murther one another to preſerve it? That is it which is the moſt horrid of all, that men do love that honour beyond their lives. And yet this contagious itch of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which were enough to ſoyle the beſt and holieſt actions, if they were refer'd to that end, ſhall have the faculty to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the moſt criminal, becauſe they are referr'd to that end? What confuſion is this, Fathers, and who ſees not what exceſſes may be the iſſue of it?</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:115411:184"/>
               <p>For it is apparent, that it will be ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to killing for the moſt inconſiderable things, when it ſtands upon a mans honour to preſerve them; nay I tell you ſo far as to kill <hi>for an apple.</hi> You would raiſe againſt me, fathers, and would ſay that I draw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious conſequences from your doctrine, were I not ſtilted up by the authority of grave <hi>Leſſius,</hi> who, <hi>num.</hi> 68. ſpeaks thus. <hi>It is not lawfull for one man to kill another to preſerve a thing of little value, as for a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a crown,</hi> OR FOR AN AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE, AUT PRO POMO, <hi>unleſſe it ſhould be a great diſhonour to him to loſe it: For in ſuch a caſe a man may recover it, nay if need be, to that end kill the perſon that hath it; et ſi opus, occidere: becauſe this is not ſo much to defend one's goods as ones honour.</hi> This is cleare enough, Fathers; And to conclude your doctrine with a maxime that comprehends all the reſt, take this of your Father <hi>Hereau,</hi> who had it out of <hi>Leſſius; The right of defending ones ſelfe extends to what ever is neceſſary to ſecure us from whatſoever may be of injury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſtrange conſequences are there lodged in this in humane principle! How is all the world obliged to oppoſe it, and above all, thoſe that have any relation to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115411:185"/> the publick. It is not onely the general intereſt that engages them thereto, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their own private intereſt, ſince your Caſuiſts, cited in my Letters, extend their permiſſions to kill, even to them. Thus the factious who fear puniſhment for their attempts, which yet never ſeem unjuſt to them, eaſily perſwaded that they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd by violence, will preſently believe that the right of defending ones ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, whatſoever is neceſſary to ſecure a man from a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l injury. They will never be troubled with that remorſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which ſmothers ſo many crimes as ſoon as they are brought forth, and will make it their onely buſineſs to overcome the external obſtacles that lye in their way.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of them here, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, no more then of the murthers you have permitted, which are yet more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and of greater concernment to the State then all theſe whereof <hi>Leſſius</hi> treats ſo openly in the 4. and 10. <hi>doubts,</hi> and not onely he but a many more of your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. It were to be wiſh'd that theſe horrid maximes had never come out of hell, and that the Devil, who is the firſt Author of them, had never met with men
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115411:185"/> ſo far devoted to his orders as to publiſh them among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>From all I have ſaid hitherto, it may be eaſily judg'd what a vaſt contrariety there is between your degenerate opinions and the rigour of civil and Pagan Laws. What will they be when compar'd to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws which muſt be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably much more holy: ſince it is the Church that onely knows and poſſeſſes true holineſs? With much more reaſon, hath this chaſt ſpouſe of the Son of God, who in imitation of her Beloved can well ſhed her own bloud for others, and not that of others for her ſelf, a particular hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for Murther, ſuch as is proportionable to the particular illumination God hath honour'd her with. She conſiders men, not onely as men, but as the images of that God whom ſhe adores. She hath for every one of them an holy reſpect which makes them all venerable, as redeem'd by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite price, to be made the Temples of the living God. Accordingly ſhe looks on the death of a man kill'd without the order of God, not onely as Homicide, but as Sacriledge alſo, depriving her of one of her members, ſince that whether he be one of the faithful or not, ſhe ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115411:186"/> him as either actually being one of her members, or in a capacity to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>For, Fathers, ſince God became Man for the ſalvation of men, their condition is ſo conſiderable to the Church, that ſhe hath ever puniſh'd Homicide, whereby they are deſtroyed, as one of the greateſt crimes can be committed againſt God. I will give you ſome inſtances of it, not with any thoughts that all thoſe ſeverities ought to be continued; I know the Church is at liberty to diſpoſe ſeveral wayes of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour diſcipline, but onely to ſhew you, what her unchangeable ſpirit is as to this particular. For the penances ſhe enjoyns for murther may be different according to the diverſity of times; but the horror ſhe hath for it no viciſſitude of time can ever change.</p>
               <p>The Church, for a long time would not be reconciled, til the approches of death, to thoſe who were guilty of voluntary mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch as are thoſe which you permit. The famous Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi> condemns them to penance during life; and the Church hath ſince thought her ſelf very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent towards them by reducing that time to a great number of years. But the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115411:186"/> more to deter Chriſtians from voluntary murthers, ſhe hath moſt ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even thoſe that happened by chance and imprudence, as may be ſeen in Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory Nyſſenus,</hi> in the Decretals of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> II. The Canons cited by <hi>Iſaac</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Langres, t.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13. ordaine ſeven years penance for one that kills another in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Be not then ſo confident as to affirm your deciſions to be conformable to the ſpirit and Canons of the Church. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you to produce any one among thoſe that gives permiſſion to kill for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ones <hi>goods</hi> onely: for I ſpeak not of thoſe occaſions wherein a man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to endeavour the ſafety of his life.

The ſpirit of the Church is abſolutely contrary to theſe ſeditious Maximes, which open ſo wide a gap to all inſurrections, whereto the populace is ſo naturally inclined. She hath ever taught her Children, that they ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn evil for evil; that a man ſhould ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his indignation; not reſiſt violence; render to every one what is due to him, honour, tribute, ſubmiſſion: to obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Superiours though unjuſt, becauſe we ought alwayes to regard in them the power of God which hath ſet them over us. She forbids men, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly then the Civil Laws do, to be their own carvers in point of juſtice; and it is by her ſpirit that Chriſtian Kings do it not themſelves, even in crimes of Treaſon of the higheſt nature, but put the criminals into the hands of the Judges, that ſo they might be puniſhed according to the Laws, and proceedings of juſtice; which are ſo
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115411:187"/> far contrary to your carriage, that the oppoſition there is between them cannot but make you bluſh. For ſince this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe engages me ſo far, I ſhall intreat you to conſider well this compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wayes whereby a man may kill his enemies, according to you, and thoſe obſerved by the Judges in putting condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſons to death.</p>
               <p>It is granted by all the world, Fathers, that private men are never permitted to demand the death of any one: and that though a man ſhould ruine us, lame us, ſet our houſes on fire, kill our parents, and beſides all this, were reſolv'd to aſſaſſinate us, and to ruine our reputation, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate would not in juſtice hearken to the demand we ſhould make for his death. So that there was a neceſſity of appointing publick perſons who ſhould demand it on the behalf of the King, or indeed rather of God. What think you, Fathers, was it for terrour and formality that Chriſtian Judges took this courſe? Or did they not do ſo, to make the Civil Laws conſonant to thoſe of the Goſpel, that ſo the external execution of Juſtice ſhould not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the internal ſentiments which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to have? It is eaſily ſeen how
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115411:188"/> far theſe firſt proceedings of Juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you; but what is yet to come will certainly cruſh you to the ground.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then, Fathers, that thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſons demand the death of him who hath committed all theſe crimes, what will be done? Will they preſently ſtick a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his breaſt? No, Fathers, a mans life is of greater conſequence; men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with more tenderneſs; it is a thing lies not at the devotion of all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but is to be diſpoſ'd of onely by Judges, of whoſe integrity and abilities there is ſufficient experience. And do you think that one is enough to condemn a man to death? No, Fathers, there muſt be at leaſt ſeven. Of theſe ſeven there muſt not be any one that hath been injur'd by the perſon indicted, left his judgment ſhould by paſſion be chang'd or corrupted. And you know, Fathers, that to the end, their ſpirits may be the more purified, it is obſerv'd to this day that the morning is appointed for theſe imployments. So great caution is there uſed to prepare them for ſo great an action, as wherein they are the Lieutenants and Miniſters of God, not to condemn any but ſuch as he condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>And that they may act as faithful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſers of that divine power of taking away mens lives, they are ſtrictly to judge according to the depoſitions of Witneſſes, and according to all the other formalities they are to obſerve; All which done, they cannot in conſcience pronounce ſentence but according to the Laws, nor judge any worthy of death, but ſuch as the Law condemns. And then, Fathers, if the order of God oblig'd them to proceed to execution upon the bodies of theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the ſame order of God doth alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to be careful of their ſinful ſouls; and it is becauſe they are ſinful, that they are oblig'd to be the more careful of them: ſo that they are not turn'd over to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till ſuch time as they have had the means to provide for their Conſciences. All this ſeems to ſpeak abundance of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and innocence, and yet the Church hath ſuch an averſion to bloud, that ſhe holds thoſe uncapable to ſerve at her altars who had been employed about any execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſentence of death, though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all theſe ſo religious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: whence it is not hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what Idea the Church hath of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:115411:189"/>
               <p>Thus you ſee, Fathers, how mens lives are diſpoſ'd of according to <hi>juſtice,</hi> let us now ſee how <hi>you</hi> diſpoſe of them. In your new laws, there is but one Judge; and that Judge is himſelf the party injured. He is at the ſame time Judge, party, and executioner. He demands, of himſelf, the death of his enemy; he condemns him, he immediately executes him, and without any regard either of the body or ſoul of his Brother, he kills and damns him for whom JESUS CHRIST dyed, all this to avoid a box o'th' ear, or an opprobrious or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontive ſpeech, or ſome offence of the like nature, for which a Judge, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with lawful authority, ſhould be guilty himſelf ſhould he condemn thoſe that had committed them; becauſe the Laws are far from condemning them. And in a word, to make your exceſſes full weight, a man contracts neither ſin nor irregularity when he kills in that manner without authority and contrary to the Laws, though he be a religious man, nay a Prieſt.

                  </gap>re are we, Fathers, Are they religious men and Prieſts that ſpeak after this rate? Are they Chriſtians? Are they Turks? Are they men? Are they Devils? And are theſe the <hi>Myſteries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115411:189"/> by the Lambe to thoſe of his Society;</hi> or abominations ſuggeſted by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon into thoſe that follow his party?</p>
               <p>For in a word, Fathers, what would you have men take you to be, children of the Goſpel, or enemies to the Goſpel? you muſt needs be of the one or the other, there is no mean; <hi>He that is not with Jeſus Christ is againſt him.</hi> This dichotomy of mankind comprehends all: There are two peoples, and two worlds ſcattered over the face of the earth, according to Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi> the world of the children of God, which makes up a body whereof Jeſus Chriſt is head and King; and the world that is at enmity with God, whereof the Devil is head and King. For this reaſon is Jeſus Chriſt called the King and God of the world, becauſe he hath every where ſubjects and adorers; and the Devil is alſo called in ſcripture the Prince of this world, and the God of this age, becauſe he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where creatures and Captives. Jeſus Chriſt hath given the Church, which is his Empire, ſuch Lawes as he according to his eternall wiſdome thought fit; and the Devil hath given the world, which is his kingdome, the Lawes he would have obſerved therein. Jeſus Chriſt hath
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115411:190"/> placed honour in ſuffering, the Devil in not ſuffering. Jeſus Chriſt hath bidden thoſe who receive a blow on one cheek to turn the other alſo; and the Devil bids thoſe to whom a blow is to be given, kill ſuch as would do them that injury. Jeſus Chriſt declares thoſe bleſſed who partake with him in his ignominy; and the devil declares thoſe curſed that are in ignominy. Jeſus Chriſt ſayes, woe unto you, when men ſpeak good things of you; and the devil ſayes, woe unto thoſe of whom the world ſpeaks not with eſteeme.</p>
               <p>Conſider now, Fathers, whether of the two Kingdomes you are of. You have heard the language of the City of Peace which is called the myſticall Jeruſalem; and you have alſo heard the language of the City of Diſquiet called by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Spirituall Sodome:</hi> which of theſe two languages do you underſtand? which do you ſpeak? Thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt have the ſame ſentiments with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; and thoſe who are the children of the Devil, <hi>ex patre Diabolo,</hi> who was a murtherer from the beginning, practiſe the maximes of the Devil, according to the words of Jeſus Chriſt. Let us then heare the language of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115411:190"/> your School, and ask your Authors; when a man ſmites us on the cheek, ſhould we endure it or kill him that would give it; or is it lawfull to kill him to avoid the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front? it is lawfull, as <hi>Leſſius, Molina, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcobar, Reginaldus, Filiutius, Bald llus,</hi> and other <hi>Jeſuits affirme, to kill him who would give us a box o'th' eare.</hi> Is this the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Jeſus Christ?</hi> your anſwer again to this; were a man diſhonourable for ſuffering a box o'th eare till ſuch time as he had killed him that had given it? <hi>Is it not certain,</hi> ſayes <hi>Eſcobar, that while a man ſuffers him to live of whom he hath received a box o'th eare, he remaines without honour.</hi> Very right, Fathers, without that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which the Devil hath derived out of his own proud ſpirit, into that of his proud children. Tis this honour which hath ever been the Idol of men poſſeſſed by the ſpirit of the world. Tis to preſerve this glory, whereof the evil ſpirit is the true diſpoſer, that they ſacrifice their lives, by Duells, which they are ſo ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; their honour by the infamy of the puniſhments they ly ſubject to; and their eternall happineſſe, by the hazard of damnation which they run, and which by the Eccleſiaſticall Canons deprives them of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115411:191"/> Chriſtian buriall. We are therefore to give God the praiſe, that he hath illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Kings mind with purer lights then thoſe of your Theologie. His ſo ſevere Edicts upon this occaſion have not made the fighting of Duels a crime, they onely puniſh the crime which is inſeparable from it. The fear of the rigour of his juſtice hath deterred thoſe whom the feare of Gods juſtice hath not; and his piety per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him, that the Honour of Chriſtians conſiſts in the obſervation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and not in that chimaera of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which you pretend, as frivolous as it is, to be a juſtifiable excuſe for Murthers. Thus are your murthering deciſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable to all the world, and it were your better courſe to change your judgement, if not out of conſiderations of Religion, out of thoſe of policy. Prevent, Fathers, by a voluntary recantation of theſe inhumane opinions, the lewd conſequences which may follow them, and for which you one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be accountable. And to be the more ſtruck with the horrour of <hi>homicide,</hi> remember that the firſt crime of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mankind was murther committed on the perſon of the firſt juſt man; that the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115411:191"/> greateſt crime of men was a murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the perſon of him that is head of all the juſt; and that <hi>Homicide</hi> is the onely crime that at the ſame time deſtroys the State, the Church, Nature, and Piety.</p>

               <p>SInce your impoſtures like Hydras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe dayly, and that they are your offenſive armes to perſecute with ſo much cruelty all godly perſons that any way op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your Errours, I conceive my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd as well for their intereſt, as that of the Church, to unvail a certain myſterie in your proceedings, which I have long ſince promiſed, that it may be diſcovered, even out of your own Maximes, what credit men ſhould give your accuſations and your reproches.</p>
               <p>I know, that thoſe who are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acquainted with you are in a great irreſolution what to think of theſe things, as finding themſelves in an inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of either believing the incredible crimes wherewith you charge your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or taking you for Impoſtors, which alſo ſeems a thing incredible to them on
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115411:193"/> the other ſide. How, ſay they, if theſe things were not ſo, would Religious men publiſh them, and would they ſo far bely their conſciences as to damn themſelves by theſe calumnies? Thus do they diſcourſe with themſelves; and ſo the evident proofs, whereby your falſifications are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, croſſing the opinion they have of your ſincerity, they are in ſuſpence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the clearneſs of the Truth, which they cannot deny, and the obſervation of charity which they are afraid to make a breach of. So that as the onely thing that hinders them from ſhaking off your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious language is the eſteem they have for you; ſo when they ſhall be once ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that you have not that Idea of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which they imagine you have, and that you think to work out your ſalvation by reviling your enemies, it is out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the weight of truth will ſo fix their faith, as that they ſhall no longer credit your impoſtures. This, Fathers, ſhall be the deſign and ſubject of this Letter. I ſhall not onely think it ſufficient to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that your writings are fraught with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but calumnies, but go a little further with you. It is poſſible a man may tell things that are falſe believing them to be
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:115411:193"/> true; but the character of a Liar implies the intention of lying. I ſhall therefore make it appear, Fathers, that it is your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to lie and calumniate, and that it is done wittingly and with deſign that you charge your enemies with thoſe crimes whereof you know them to be innocent, becauſe you think it may be done without falling from the ſtate of Grace. And though you are as well acquainted as I am with this point of your Moralitie, yet ſhall I ſtill inſiſt upon it, that none may doubt of it, when they ſee me addreſs my ſelf to you ſo to maintain it to your faces that you ſhall not have the confidence to deny it, but you muſt, by ſuch diſacknowledgment, confirme my objections againſt you for it. It is ſo notorious a doctrine in your Schools, that you have maintain'd it, not onely in your books, but alſo in your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Theſes, which certainly is the height of confidence; as among others in your Theſes of <hi>Lovain,</hi> of the year 1645. in theſe termes, <hi>It is onely a venial ſin to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, and impoſe falſe crimes, to ruine their credit who ſpeak ill of us: Quidni non niſi veniale ſit, detrahentis authoritatem, tibi noxiam, falſo crimine elidere?</hi> And this doctrine is ſo much in vogue among
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115411:194"/> you, that you treat him as an ignorant and temerarious perſon, who preſumes any way to oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>This hath been, not long ſince, the ſad fate of Father <hi>Quiroga</hi> a German <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin,</hi> when he endeavoured to oppoſe it. For your Father <hi>Dicaſtillus</hi> preſently takes him up, and in that diſpute ſpeaks of him in theſe termes, <hi>de Juſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 12. <hi>num.</hi> 404. <hi>A certain grave Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, bare-hoof'd and deep-cowl'd, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullatus, gymnipoda, whom I name not, was ſo raſh as to cry down this opinion among a ſort of women and ignorant people, and to affirme that it was pernicious and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, prejudicial to good manners, contrary to the quiet and tranquillity of States and Societies, and in a word, contrary, not onely to all Catholick Doctors, but alſo to all thoſe that might be Catholick. But I have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained againſt him, and do ſtill maintain, that Calumny when it is uſ'd againſt a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator, though grounded on abſolute fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, is not for that any mortal ſin either againſt Juſtice or Charity. And to prove it, I have brought a cloud of our Fathers to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it, and whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities conſiſting of them, all whom I have conſulted, and among others, the Reverend Father</hi> John Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Inſomuch that you have accordingly authoriſed it ſo far, that the Caſuiſts quote it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible principle. <hi>It is moſt certain,</hi> ſayes <hi>Caramouel, num.</hi> 1151. <hi>that it is a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, that it is not any mortal ſin to calumniate falſly to preſerve ones honour.

                  <hi>Jeſuits, &amp;c. ſo that if this doctrine were not probable, there were hardly any ſuch in all the body of Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What abominable Divinity is this, which is ſo corrupt in all its main heads, that, if it be not profitable, and ſecure in point of Conſcience, that a man may calumniate where there is no crime; to preſerve his honour, there is hardly any of all its deciſions that is ſuch! How proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it, Fathers, that thoſe who maintain this principle, ſhould not ſometimes put it in practiſe? The degenerate inclination of men is apt enough of it ſelfe to bend them that way, and that ſo violently, that it muſt needs break out with all its natural impetuoſity, when the obſtacle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is once taken away. Would you have an inſtance of it? <hi>Caramouel</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes you in the ſame place. <hi>This Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of Father</hi> Dicaſtillus <hi>the Jeſuit, concerning Calumny having been, by a Counteſs of</hi> Germanie, <hi>taught the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs's Daughters, the confidence they thence took that it was no ſin, at moſt but venial, to ſcatter calumnies up and down, bred in a few dayes ſo many, together with ſo much opprobrious language, and ſuch a number of falſe reports, that it put the whole Court into alarm and combuſtion. For it is not hard to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:115411:195"/> imagine what uſe they might make of it;</hi> ſo that to appeaſe this <hi>tumult, they were forced to ſend for a Religious Capuchin, a man of an exemplary life, named Father</hi> Quiroga, ('twas this that <hi>Dicaſtillus</hi> quarrell'd with him ſo much for) <hi>who came and made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them that that Maxime was a moſt pernicious one, eſpecially among women, and he took a particular care to oblige the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs abſolutely to aboliſh the uſe of it.</hi> There is no reaſon to be ſurpriſ'd at the lewd conſequences of this Doctrine. It were, on the contrarie, a miracle it ſhould not produce this looſneſs. Self-love is ever prone enough to perſwade us, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any thing is laid to our charge, it is unjuſtly; much more may it you, Fathers, whom Vanitie hath ſo ſtrangely blinded, as that you would make the world believe in all your writings, that to blaſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your Society is to derogate from that of the Church. And thus, Fathers, were there ſome reaſon to think it ſtrange you ſhould not put this Maxime in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. For we muſt no longer affirme that of you, which ſome have done that know you not: <hi>How! would they calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate their Enemies, when they cannot do it without endangering their Salvation?</hi> But
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115411:196"/> we muſt on the contrarie ſay thus; How, would they let ſlip the advantage of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting their enemies when they may do it without hazarding their Salvation? Be it therefore no longer a miracle to find the Jeſuits Detractors; they are ſuch in ſafety of conſcience, and nothing can hinder them from being ſo, ſince that by the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit they have in the world they may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate without any fear of being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the juſtice of men, and that by the prerogatives they aſſume to themſelves in caſes of conſcience, they have eſtabliſh'd ſuch Maximes as that they may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear of the juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>This, this, Fathers, is the ſource whence ſpring ſo many horrid impoſtures. This is the treaſury whence your Father <hi>Briſaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> was ſo well furniſh'd as to ſcatter ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that they drew upon him the cenſure of the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> This it was that engag'd your Father <hi>d'Anjou</hi> to diſcredit, even in the Pulpit, in the Church of <hi>Benedict,</hi> on the 8. of <hi>March</hi> 1655. thoſe perſons of qualitie who receiv'd the charitie for the poor of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn,</hi> whereto they contributed ſo much themſelves; and with an horrid falſitie to affirme, and ſuch as might well damme up

And how durſt a man imagine that a paſſage is, <hi>in terminis,</hi> in the very place where it is cited, when there is not the leaſt mark or track of it in all the book?</p>
               <p>This, Fathers, is certainly a courſe to gain credit till you are anſwered, but it is alſo the onely way never to be credited af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are once anſwered. For it is ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that you lyed at that time, that at this day you make no difficulty to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in your Anſwers, that this maxime is in Father <hi>Bauny,</hi> in the very place where it is cited; and the miracle is, that where it was deteſtable twelve years ſince, it is now grown ſo innocent, that in your ninth Impoſture, <hi>p.</hi> 10. you charge me
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:115411:201"/> with ignorance and malice for quarrelling with Father <hi>Bauny</hi> upon an opinion which hath not been refuted in the Schooles. What an advantage is it, Fathers, to have to do with people who can indifferently ſay <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con?</hi> I ſhall need onely your ſelves to confound you; for I have but two things to make appeare. One is, that this maxime is a pernicious one; the other, that it is Father <hi>Bauny's;</hi> and I will prove both by your own confeſſion. In the yeare 1644. You acknowledged it to be deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in 1656. you confeſſe it to be Father <hi>Bauny's.</hi> Though this double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement be enough for my juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet doth it do ſomething beyond it; it diſcovers the ſpirit of your Politicks. For, tell me, I beſeech you, what end you propoſe to your ſelves in your Writings: Is it to deliver your ſelves with ſincerity? No, Fathers, it cannot, ſince your Anſwers deſtroy one another. Is it to comply with the truth in point of faith? No more; ſince you authoriſe a maxime that by your own acknowledgement is <hi>deteſtable.</hi> But we are to conſider, that when you affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this maxime to be <hi>deſteſtable,</hi> you with the ſame breath denyed it to be Father <hi>Baunys,</hi> and ſo he was innocent: and when
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115411:201"/> you acknowledged it to be his, you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maintain it to be good, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he is innocent ſtill. So that the innocence of that Father being the onely thing that is common to both your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, it is alſo cleare, that it is the onely thing you drive at therein, and that all your buſineſſe is to vindicate your own Father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, by affirmng, of the ſame maxime, that it is in your Bookes and that it is not; that it is good, and that it is bad; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, which never changes, but according to your intereſt, which changes every minute. What could I not ſay to you upon this advantage, for you ſee it is very demonſtrative? And yet this is but your ordinary courſe. But to avoid abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of examples, I think you will give me an acquittance that you are ſatisfyed if I adde but one more to the former ſumme.</p>
               <p>You have, at ſeverall times, been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched with that other propoſition of the ſame Father <hi>Bauny, tr.</hi> 4. <hi>q.</hi> 22. <hi>p.</hi> 100. <hi>A Prieſt ought not to deny thoſe abſolution who remains in habituall crimes contrary to the Lawes of God, Nature and the Church, though they diſcover not the leaſt hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; etſi emendationis futurae spes nulla appareat.</hi> Now I would I have you
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:115411:202"/> tell me, Fathers, whether in your opinion hath beſt anſwered it, your Father <hi>Printe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau,</hi> or your Father <hi>Briſacier,</hi> who vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Father <hi>Bauny</hi> after thoſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manners; one, by condemning the propoſition, but withall not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be his; the other by granting it to be Father <hi>Bauny's,</hi> but at the ſame time juſtifying it? Heare them diſcourſe. Father <hi>Pintereau, pag.</hi> 18. ſayes thus. <hi>What may be called breaking the reines of all modeſty, and to exceed all impudence, if not, to charge Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Bauny <hi>with ſo damnable a doctrine, as a thing of all ſides acknowledged?

               </p>
               <p>What think you, Fathers, of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Atheiſtical expreſſions? That if it be but requiſite to ſtay till <hi>there were ſome hopes of amendment</hi> in ſinners ere they ſhould be abſolv'd, it is as much as if there were a neceſſity of ſtaying <hi>till God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould ſwear by his head,</hi> that they ſhould fall into the ſame ſins no more? How, Fathers, is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Certainty?</hi> How injurious is it to the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, to affirm, that there is ſo little poſſibility that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould ever get out of crimes that are contrary to the Laws of God, nature, and the Church, that it is not ſo much as to be hoped, unleſs <hi>the holy Ghoſt be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</hi> So that, in your judgment, if thoſe be not abſolv'd <hi>of whom there's no hope of amendment,</hi> the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt will be uſeleſs, and <hi>will never be applyed to any.</hi> To what precipices, fathers, does this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate deſire of keeping up the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Authors reduce you, ſince you find but two wayes to juſtifie them, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:115411:203"/> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> and conſequently, that the more innocent way of vindicating them is confidently to diſacknowledge things that are moſt evident.</p>
               <p>And indeed thence it proceeds that you make uſe of it ſo often. But this is not yet all that you are able to do. You forge writings to caſt an odium on your enemies, as for inſtance, <hi>The Letter from a Miniſter to Monſieur Arnauld,</hi> which by your Mercuries you ſcatter'd up and down all <hi>Paris,</hi> to make people believe, that the book of <hi>Frequent Communion,</hi> approv'd by ſo many Doctors and Biſhops, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as was a little different from your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, had been written by ſome ſecret Intelligence with the Miniſters of <hi>Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> You ſometimes father on your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries writings full of impiety, as the <hi>Circulatory Letter of the</hi> JANSENISTS, the impertinence of whoſe ſtyle too plainly diſcovers the cheat, and but too palpably betrayes the ridiculous malice of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meynier,</hi> who dares quote it as he does, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. to confirme his moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful impoſtures. You ſometimes cite books that never were in the world, as <hi>The Conſtitutions of the Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> out of which you alledge ſuch paſſages as
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115411:203"/> are the ideal iſſues of your own braines, and which ſtartle the ſimple ſort of people, who are unacquainted with your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as well in the inventing as publiſhing of Lies. For there is not any kind of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny which you have not put in practice. Never could the Maxime that juſtifies it come into better hands.</p>
               <p>But theſe haply are too eaſily refuted; and therefore 'tis but fit you had ſome yet more ſubtile, wherein you do not particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize any thing, ſo to cut off all advantage of anſwering them; as when Father <hi>Briſacier</hi> ſaid, <hi>that his Enemies commit abominable crimes, but that he will not diſcover them;</hi> Does it ſeem ſomething hard to lay open the impoſture of ſo indeterminate a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch? And yet there is one excellent man hath found out the ſecret of it; and 'tis a <hi>Capuchin</hi> too; The <hi>Capuchins,</hi> Fathers, are very fatal to you at the preſent, and I ſee a day coming, that the Benedictines may be no leſs. This Capuchin is called Father <hi>Valerian,</hi> one of the houſe of the Counts <hi>de Magnis.</hi> You ſhall know by this ſhort ſtory how he anſwer'd your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.

They alſo ſcatter'd abroad a Letter againſt him, wherein they ſaid, <hi>O what things is it in our power to diſcover,</hi> not mentioning what, <hi>which would trouble you to the heart! For if you take not ſome courſe therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall be forc'd to acquaint the Pope and Cardinals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi> This indeed ſpeaks ſubtiltie enough; and I doubt not, Fathers, but you will ſpeak thus of me; but obſerve well how he anſwers it in his book printed at <hi>Prague</hi> this laſt year, in the 112. and following pages. <hi>What ſhall I do,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>againſt theſe uncertain and indeterminate injuries? How ſhall I diſcover the falſhood of reproches not particularized? Thus Ile do it. I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publickly declare to thoſe that threaten me, that they are infamous Impoſtors, and most accompliſh'd and moſt impudent Liars, if they diſcover not thoſe crimes to all the world.

You are ſometimes extremely put to your ſhifts; and yet you are never the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. For not long after you ſet upon him afreſh, upon another occaſion, and he took the ſame courſe to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 151. in theſe termes. <q>This kind of men, which grows daily more and more inſupportable to all Chriſtendome, would fain, under pretence of good works aſpire to greatneſs and dominion, by making contributarie to their ends all Laws, divine, humane, poſitive, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. They either out of a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115411:205"/> of their Learning, out of fear, or out of hope, draw all the great ones of the earth after them, abuſing their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bring about their deteſtable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues.

I have put a rub before their impudence, and will keep it back in the ſame manner as I did before. I declare therefore, that they lie moſt impudently, MENTIRI IMPUDEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISSIME. If the things they lay to my charge be true, let them be prov'd, or let my adverſaries ſtand convicted of a lie, full of impudence. The proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon will diſcover which ſide Reaſon ſticks to. I deſire all the world to obſerve it, and withall to take notice that this kind of men who ſuffer not the moſt inconſiderable injurie which they can avoid, pretend very patiently to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:115411:205"/> thoſe which they cannot, and ſo, with a counterfeit Virtue, clothe their real weakneſs. For this reaſon have I the more earneſtly provoked their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, to the end the more unletter'd may be ſatisfied; that if they hold their peace, their patience ſhall not be thought an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the quiet, but the diſturbance of their Conſciences.</q>

               <p>Thus far he, Fathers. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus. <hi>Theſe men, whoſe Histories are known to all the world, are ſo evidently unjuſt, and withall ſo inſolent in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, that I muſt needs have renounced</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and his Church, ſhould I not deteſt their proceedings, and that publickly, as well to vindicate my ſelf, as to hinder the ſimple from being ſeduced by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reverend Fathers, you are now in ſuch a Poſt that it is impoſſible to retreat. You muſt now be accounted Calumniators con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and have recourſe to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, <hi>viz.</hi> that this kind of calumny is no crime. This honeſt Capuchin hath light on the ſecret of putting a padlock on your mouths; and this muſt be the courſe when ever you accuſe people without proof. Theres no more to be done then to anſwer any one of you as the Capucher did, <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinis

               </p>
               <p>In like manner, what anſwer can be made thoſe indeterminate diſcourſes of that nature which are in your books, and <hi>Advertiſements</hi> upon my <hi>Letters.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>That ſome detaine the reſtitution put into their hands, and by that means bring the Creditors to Beggery: That bags of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been offer'd ſome Religious men who have refuſ'd them. That Benefices are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred purpoſely to breed hereſies contrary to Faith. That ſome have penſioners among the moſt eminent of the Clergie, nay even in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Courts. That I am alſo a Penſioner of</hi> Port-Royal, <hi>and that before I writ my</hi> Letters, <hi>I made</hi> Romances, <hi>though I never read any one, and am yet to learn the names of thoſe which your Apologiſt hath made.</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:115411:206"/> What can be ſaid to all this, Fathers, but onely, <hi>mentiris impudentiſſimè</hi> if you do not particularize all theſe perſons, their words, the time, and the place? For 'twere fit you ſhould either be ſilent, or prove all theſe circumſtances, as I do, when I tell you the ſtories of <hi>John d' Alba,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alby.</hi> Otherwiſe you will prejudice none but your ſelves.

It is time to reſtore their reputation to ſo many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated perſons. For what innocence can be ſo generally acknowledg'd but that it may ſuffer ſome violence by the ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent impoſtures of a Society ſcatter'd over the face of the Earth, which under <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> habits covers ſouls ſo irreligious as can commit ſuch crimes as <hi>Calumny,</hi> and that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115411:207"/> not contrary, but according to their own Maximes. So that I may defie all cenſure that may fall upon me, for diſcrediting the confidence men repoſ'd in you; ſince it is much more juſt to preſerve to ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as you have diſgrac'd that reputation of Pietie which they ought not to loſe, then to leave you that reputation of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which you do not any way deſerve. And as the one could not be done without the other, of what conſequence is it to the world to underſtand truly what you are? That is it I am now entred upon, but to go through with it requires abundance of time. But it ſhall come abroad, Fathers, and all your Politicks ſhall not deliver you from it; ſince that the endeavours you ſhould make uſe of to avoid it, would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie the moſt unconcern'd in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that you were afraid, and that your Conſciences charging you with what I had to ſay to you, you have uſ'd all the means you could to prevent it.</p>

               <p>I Now come to the remainder of your Calumnies, wherein I ſhall anſwer, in the firſt place, thoſe that are yet behind of your <hi>Advertiſements.</hi> But as all your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes are equally full of them, ſo muſt they needs afford me matter enough to entertain you on this ſubject as long as I ſhall think it convenient. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to the fable you have ſcattered up and down in all your writings againſt <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> in a word affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when he onely ſayes to his friend; <hi>Trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115411:208"/> ſhall ſupply him with what is neceſſary out of the money I have in my hands,</hi> why would you have it to be underſtood, as if he ſhould ſay, that he took that money ſo as not to reſtore it again, and not that he layed ſo much out of it, to make it good after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? But what a ſtrange diſcovery do you make of your imprudence, ſince you are convicted of Lying by your own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, out of the other Letters of <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> printed by your meanes, which make it clearly appeare that what money he laid out was onely by way of AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANCE, and ſuch as he was afterwards to reimburſe. This is evident out of that you put out as of the thirtieth of July. 1619. in theſe very termes, to your confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <hi>Trouble not your ſelfe concerning any</hi> ADVANCE-MONEY, <hi>he ſhall not want any thing while I ſhall stay here.</hi> As alſo out of that of <hi>Jan.</hi> 6, 1620. where he ſayes; <hi>You are very truſty; And though the buſineſs came to ſuch a paſſe as that an account were demanded, I queſtion not but I have ſo much credit in this place as that I ſhould make a ſhift to find money if need were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt then be Impoſtors, Fathers, as well in relation to this buſineſſe, as the ridiculous ſtory of the <hi>Poores-Box</hi> of Saint
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115411:208"/> 
                  <hi>Merry.</hi> For what advantage can you make of the accuſation which one of your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put in againſt that Clergy-man, whom you would gladly teare in pieces? Muſt it be concluded that a man is guilty becauſe he is accuſed? No certainly, Fathers. Godly men, ſuch as he, will never want accuſers, while the world is furniſhed with ſuch Detractors as you are. We muſt not therefore judge of him according to the accuſation, but according to the ſentence. Now the ſentence given upon the buſineſſe <hi>Febr.</hi> 23. 1656. abſolutely cleares him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he, who was unadviſedly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in that unjuſt proſecution, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by his Collegues, and forced to diſavow it. And as to what you ſay in the ſame place of that <hi>famous director who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched himſelf, in a moment, of nine hundred thouſand Livers,</hi> there is no more to be done, then to refer you to the Paſtors of Saint <hi>Roch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who are able to ſatisfy all <hi>Paris</hi> of his abſolute diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to that buſineſſe, and of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable malice in this impoſture. We need ſay no more in anſwer to ſuch frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous falſities. Theſe are but the trialls of skill of your novices, and not the mortall blowes of your grand Profeſſors.</p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:115411:209"/>
               <p>That's it I now come to Fathers, I come, I ſay, to a Calumny the blackeſt that ever you were guilty of. I meane that inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable piece of impudence, whereby you durſt lay it to the charge of devout Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious women and their directors, <hi>That they believe not the myſtery of</hi> Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, <hi>nor the</hi> reall preſence <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</hi> This, Fathers, is an impoſture worthy of you. This is a crime which God onely is able to puniſh, and you onely to commit. There is requiſite as great an humility as that of theſe humble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſoules to ſuffer it with patience, and to believe it, requires a man ſhould be as wicked as ſuch wicked Detractors as you are. I ſhall not for my part undertake to juſtify them, they are not ſo much, as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected guilty of any ſuch thing. Stood they in need of Defenders, they might ſoone find better then I am. What I ſhall here ſay, is not to cleare their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence but to diſcover your malice. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is to make you ſtand amazed at your ſelves, and ſatisfy the world, that, this proved againſt you, there is not any thing which you may not venture upon.</p>
               <p>And yet you will not ſtick to ſay that I have ſome relation to <hi>Port Royal;</hi> for it is
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115411:209"/> the maine thing you have to caſt in all their teeth who any way oppoſe your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances, as if there were onely at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> ſuch as had zeal enough to reſcue, aga nſt you, the purity of <hi>Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</hi> I am not, Fathers, to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the great deſerts of thoſe ſolitary perſons that are retired thither, nor how much the Church is obliged to their works, as ſuch as are ſolid and full of edification. I know by what a pious light they are illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though I never was ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as you would make the world believe when you know not who I am, yet have I acquaintance with ſome of them, and an honour for the vertue of all. But God hath not limited to that number all thoſe he would have to oppoſe your diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I hope, with his aſſiſtance, to make you ſenſible of it; and if he give me the grace to go on with the deſigne he hath put me upon of employing for him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have received from him, I ſhall treat you in ſuch manner, that it ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be your greateſt regret that you have not to do with a man of <hi>Port-Royal.</hi> For whereas thoſe whom you ſo much inſult upon by that famous calumny are content onely to offer up to God their ſighs and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:115411:210"/> groanes to procure your pardon for the ſame, I think my ſelfe obliged as one that is not at all concerned in that reproch, to make you aſhamed of it before the whole Church, ſo to work in you that ſaving confuſion, whereof the Scripture ſpeakes, which is in a manner the onely remedy againſt ſuch a hardneſſe of heart as yours is. <hi>Fill their faces with confuſion, and they ſhall ſeeek thy name, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt needs put a ſtop to that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which hath not the leaſt tenderneſſe even for the holieſt places. For who can be ſecure after a calumny of this nature? How, Fathers, dare you your ſelves ſtick up and down <hi>Paris</hi> a book ſo ſcandalous, with the name of your Father <hi>Meynier</hi> in the frontiſpiece, and this infamous title, <hi>Port-Royal combining with Geneva againſt the moſt bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you charge with this. Apoſtaſie not onely M. <hi>de</hi> Saint <hi>Cyran,</hi> and M. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> but alſo Mother <hi>Agnes,</hi> his Siſter, and all the Religious women of that Monaſtery, of whom you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 96. <hi>That their faith to as much to be ſuſpected, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Euchariſt, as that of Monſieur Arnauld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> whom you hold <hi>pag.</hi> 4 <hi>to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Caviniſt.</hi> Now I appeale to all the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115411:210"/> world, whether there be in the Church any upon whom you might have ſcattered ſo abominable a reproch with leſſe probability. For, I would fain know, Fathers, if theſe Religious women and their directors combined with <hi>Geneva</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar (a thing cannot be thought without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) why ſhould they take for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall object of their piety a Sacrament which they thought an abomination? why ſhould they adde to their Rule, the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the B. Sacrament? why have they taken the habit of the B. Sacrament? why taken the name of the Nunnes of the B. Sacrament? why called their Church, the Church of the B. Sacrament? why ſhould they petition for and obtain from <hi>Rome</hi> the confirmation of that inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the priviledge to ſay every Thurſday the office of the B. Sacrament, wherein the faith of the Church is ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſſ'd, if they had conſpir'd with <hi>Geneva</hi> to aboliſh that faith of the Church? why ſhould they oblige themſelves, by a particular devotion, and that approved by the Pope, to have conſtantly night and day ſome religious women, in the preſence of that Sacred Hoaſt, as it were to repaire
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115411:211"/> by their perpetuall adorations of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſacrifice, the impiety of that hereſy that endeavoured to annihilate it? Speak Fathers, if you can; give ſome reaſon, why, of all the myſteries of our Religion, they ſhould paſſe by thoſe they do believe, and faſten on that they could not believe? And why they ſhould devote themſelves in ſo full and abſolute a manner to that myſtery of our Faith, if they took it as Hereticks do for the myſtery of iniqu ty?

For who ever hath made uſe of other termes then thoſe, and that particularly in ſimple diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Piety, where there is nothing of controverſie medled with? And yet the love and reſpect they have for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſterie, hath given them occaſion to ſpeak ſo much of it in their writings, that I defie you, Fathers, as craftie as you are, to find therein the leaſt ſhadow of ambiguity or compliance with the tenents of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the world knowes, Fathers, that the hereſie of <hi>Geneva,</hi> eſſentially conſiſts, as you expreſſe it your ſelves, in believing that Jeſus Chriſt <q>is not encloſed within that Sacrament: That it is impoſſible he ſhould be in ſeverall places; That he is truly no where but in heaven, and that there onely he is to be adored, and not upon the Altar. That the ſubſtance of the bread remaines; That the body of

               <p>This is ſufficient, Fathers, to let the world ſee evidently, that there hath not been haply ſince the beginning of it a greater impudence then this of yours. But yet I will go a little further, and make you pronounce this ſentence againſt your
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:115411:213"/> ſelves. For what caution would you have to take away all ſuſpicion of a mans conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with <hi>Geneva? If Monſieur</hi> Arnauld, ſayes your Father <hi>Meyni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have you ſeen as much in the paſſages before cited? But beſides, the Familiar Divinitie of Monſieur de Saint <hi>Cyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n</hi> being approved by M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſentiments of both. Read then the whole fifteenth Lecture, and particularly the ſecond Article, and there you ſhall find the words you deſire, and that more formally then you have expreſſed them your ſelves: <hi>Is there any bread left in the hoaſt, and any wine in the Chalice? Not any; for the whole ſubſtance of the bread, as alſo that of the wine are taken away to make place for that of the body and blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which remaines therein covered onely with the qualities and species of bread and wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Fathers, will you ſtill affirme that <hi>Port-Royal</hi> teaches nothing <hi>which is
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:115411:214"/> not receiv'd by Geneva;</hi> and that Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> hath not ſaid any thing in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Letter, which might not have been ſaid by a Miniſter of <hi>Charenton?</hi> Do you make <hi>Meſtrezat</hi> ſpeak as Monſieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi> does in that Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 237, &amp;c. <hi>That is an infamous falſity to charge him with denying Tranſ-ſubſtantiation; that he takes for the foundation of his booke the truth of the reall preſence of the Son of God, oppoſite to the hereſie of the Calviniſts; That he thinks himſelf happy to be in a place where the Holy of Holies, who is preſent in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, is continually adored:</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is a thing ſtands at a greater diſtance from the belief of the Calviniſts then the reall preſence it ſelf, ſince that as Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> ſaies in his Controverſies, <hi>pag.</hi> 536. <hi>The new Ministers of</hi> France <hi>being united with the Lutherans who believe it, have thereby declared, that they are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Church as to what relates to that myſterie, but onely by reaſon of the adoration which the Catholicks do to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</hi> Get all the paſſages I have cited out of the books of <hi>Port-Royall</hi> ſubſcribed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and not onely thoſe paſſages but the whole treatiſes written concerning this myſterie, as the book of <hi>Frequent
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115411:214"/> Communion;</hi> The <hi>Explication of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Maſſe; The Exerciſe during Maſs; Reaſons of ſuspenſion from the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament; The Hymnes of the Houres of</hi> Port-Royal <hi>tranſlated, &amp;c.</hi> In a word, cauſe that ſacred inſtitution of conſtantly adoring Jeſus Chriſt encloſ'd in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, to be eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Charenton,</hi> as it is at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and it will be the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſervice you can do the Church, ſince that then <hi>Port-Royal</hi> ſhall not conſpire with <hi>Geneva,</hi> but <hi>Geneva</hi> with <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> and the whole Church.</p>
               <p>You could not certainly, Fathers, have been more unfortunate in any thing then in charging <hi>Port-Royal</hi> with not believing the Euchariſt; but I will diſcover what it was that engag'd you to do it. You know I am a little acquainted with your Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: you have ſtretch'd them very hard upon this occaſion. If Monſieur <hi>de Saint Cyran,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> had onely deliver'd what was to be believ'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that myſterie, and not what men ought to do to be prepar'd for it, they had been the beſt Catholicks in the world, and there had been no equivocations found in their termes of <hi>reall preſence</hi> and <hi>tranſ-ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi> But ſince there is a neceſſitie that all
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:115411:215"/> thoſe who oppoſe your degenerate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhould be Hereticks, nay in that very point wherein they condemn them, how could Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſcape upon the Euchariſt, when he had writ an expreſs Treatiſe againſt your profanations of that Sacrament? How, Fathers, Should he ſay, with hope not to be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>That the body of Jeſus Chriſt ought not to be given thoſe who fall often into the ſame crimes, and diſcover not the leaſt hope of amendment, and that they ought to be kept for ſome time from the Altar, that, having purified themſelves by a ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they may approch it afterwards to their comfort.</hi> Do not, Fathers, by any means ſuffer ſuch things to be ſpoken; you would not be importun'd by ſo many people at your Confeſſion-ſeats. For your Father <hi>Briſacier</hi> ſayes, that <hi>if you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd not this method you ſhould not apply the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt to any one.</hi> 'Twere much better for you that men followed the practiſe of your Societie, which your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maſcarennas</hi> cites in a certain book approved by your Doctors, nay even by your Reverend Father General, and is this; <hi>That all manner of perſons, even Prieſts themſelves may receive the body of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115411:215"/> Jeſus Chriſt the very day wherein they have defiled themſelves with abominable ſins: That men are ſo far from being guilty of any irreverence in ſuch communions, that, on the contrary, they are to be commended, when they frequent them in that manner: That the Confeſſours ought not to divert them, and that, on the contrary it is their duty to adviſe thoſe who have but newly committed thoſe crimes, to communicate immediately, in as much as though the Church hath forbidden it, yet that prohibition is aboliſh'd by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practiſe of the whole earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This it is, Fathers, to have Jeſuits ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd over the whole earth. This is the univerſal practiſe that you have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and which you endeavour to ſee eſtabliſh'd. It matters not that the tables of Jeſus Chriſt be fill'd with abomination ſo your Churches be throng'd with people. Be ſure then to make the oppoſers hereof Hereticks upon the Bleſſed Sacrament; it muſt be ſo what ever it coſt. But how will you be able to do it after ſo many irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable teſtimonies as they have given of their faith? Are you not afraid I ſhould quote the four grand proofs you produce of their hereſie? You might very well, Fathers, and I know no reaſon I ſhould
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115411:216"/> ſpare you ſo much ſhame. Let us then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the firſt.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Saint Cyran,</hi> ſayes Father Meynier, <hi>comforting a friend of his upon the death of his Mother,</hi> Tom. 1. Let. 14. ſaies, <hi>that the most acceptable ſacrifice that a man can offer to God upon theſe occaſions is that of Patience;</hi> ergo <hi>he is a Calviniſt.</hi> This is very ſubtilly argued, Fathers; and it is a queſtion with me whether any one ſee the reaſon of this conſequence. Take it from himſelf. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith this great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſt, <hi>he therefore believes not the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs; for that is it which is the moſt acceptable to God of any.</hi> Who now dares ſay the Jeſuits cannot diſpute? They can do it in ſuch a manner, that they are able to make heretical what diſcourſes they pleaſe even to the Scripture it ſelf. For is it not an hereſie to ſay, as the wiſe man does, <hi>There is nothing worſe then to love money;</hi> as if Adulteries, Murthers, and Idolatrie were not greater crimes? And who is there almoſt who does not frequently fall into ſuch expreſſions; and that, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſacrifice of a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart is the moſt acceptable in the ſight of God; for that in ſuch diſcourſes, a man onely makes a compariſon between
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:115411:216"/> certain interiour virtues among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without reflection on the ſacrifice of the Maſs, which is of a different order, and of an infinitely higher Nature. Is not this to be ridiculous, Fathers, and muſt I needs, to heighten your confuſion, acquaint you with the termes of that very Letter, where Monſieur <hi>de Saint Cyran</hi> ſpeaks of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, as of the <hi>moſt excellent</hi> of all, ſaying, <hi>That men offer unto God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and in all places the ſacrifice o the Body of his Son, who could not find</hi> A MORE EXCELLENT WAY <hi>then that, whereby to honour his Father?</hi> And afterwards; <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt at his death oblig'd us to take of his ſacrificed body to make the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ours to be the more acceptable to him, and that he, being alſo united to us when we die, might ſtrengthen us by ſanctifying with his preſence the laſt ſacrifice we make unto God, of our lives and of our bodies.</hi> Now play the Sycophants, take no notice of any thing of all this, and confidently affirme that he avoided communicating at his death, as you do <hi>pag.</hi> 33. and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd not the ſacrifice of the Maſs. For there is nothing too difficult for ſuch as are Detractors by Profeſſion.</p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:115411:217"/>
               <p>And that you are ſuch, your ſecond proof is a great teſtimony. To make late Monſieur <hi>de Saint Cyran,</hi> (to whom you attribute the book of <hi>Petrus Aurelius</hi>) a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> you produce a paſſage, wherein <hi>Aurelius</hi> explaines (<hi>pag.</hi> 89.) the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Church towards ſuch Prieſts and Biſhops as ſhe would depoſe or degrade. <hi>The Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to take away the power of the order, becauſe the character of it is not to be blotted out, ſhe does all ſhe can: ſhe puts out of her memory that character which ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not out of the ſouls of thoſe who have received it. She conſiders them as if they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Prieſts or Biſhops. So that according to the ordinary language of the Church, it may be ſaid they are no longer ſuch, though they ſtill are as to what concerns the character; ob indelebilitatem characteris.</hi> You ſee, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that this Author, approv'd by three general Aſſemblies of the Clergie of <hi>France,</hi> ſaies expreſly, <hi>that the character of Prieſthood is indelible;</hi> and yet you make him ſay but quite the contrarie in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, <hi>That the character of Prieſthood is not indelible.</hi> This is a tranſcendent calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that is to ſay, according to you, a <hi>Peccadillo,</hi> a trifling venial ſin. For that
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:115411:217"/> book had done you ſome prejudice, as having refuted the hereſies of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren-Jeſuits of <hi>England</hi> concerning Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Authoritie. But certainly, it is a ſignal piece of extravagance, and a very high mortal ſin againſt Reaſon, in the firſt place, faſly to ſuppoſe that Monſieur <hi>de Saint Cyran</hi> held that the character might be taken away, and to conclude thence, that he does not believe the reall preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</p>
               <p>Do not expect I ſhould make any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, Fathers; if you have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, it is not in my power to give you any. All thoſe that have will liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laugh at both you and your third proof, which is grounded upon theſe words out of the <hi>Frequent Communion,</hi> 3. <hi>p. ch.</hi> 11. <hi>That God gives us in the Euchariſt</hi> THE SAME FOOD <hi>as he doth to the Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cannot but pitie you. Fathers. Does this require any further explication? Why do you confound this divine Nouriſhment with the manner of receiving it? There is, as I have alreadie ſaid, but one onely difference between this nouriſhment upon earth and in heaven, which is, that here it is hidden under veils that deprive us of the ſenſible ſight and taſte of it. But there are many differences between the <hi>wayes</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it both here and there, whereof the principal is, as Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſaies, <hi>part.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>Here Chriſt enters into the mouth and breaſt of both the godly and the wicked,</hi> which he doth not in heaven.</p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:115411:218"/>
               <p>And ſince you are ignorant of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie I ſhall tell you, that the cauſe why God hath eſtabliſhed theſe different waies of receiving the ſame food is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between the ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this life and that of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> J ſus Chriſt, becauſe it is the propertie of the Law to have onely the ſhadow and not the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115411:219"/> ſubſtance of things: and we ſhould alſo go out on the other ſide, ſhould we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs him viſibly; becauſe faith, as the ſame Apoſtle ſayes, is not of the things that are ſeen. Thus is the Euchariſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to our ſtate of Faith, becauſe it truly involves Ieſus Chriſt, yet veiled. So that this ſtate were on the one ſide deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if Ieſus Chriſt were not really under the ſpecies of bread and wine, as Hereticks pretend he is not; and on the other, ſhould we receive him nakedly as in heaven, ſince it were to confound our eſtate either with that of Judaiſme or with that of Glory. And this, Fathers, is the divine and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious reaſon of this wholly divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This is it makes us abhor the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> as reducing us to the condition of the Jews; and withall what makes us aſpire to the glory of the Bleſſed, wherein we ſhall have the full and eternal enjoyment of Jeſus Chriſt. Whence you ſee that there are ſeveral d fferences between the waies wherein he communicates himſelf to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and to the Bleſſed, and that, among others, he is received here by the mouth, and not ſo in heaven; but that they all depend meerly upon the difference there is between the ſtate of Faith, wherein we are,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:115411:219"/> and the eſtate of the beatifical viſion wherein they are. This it is, Fathers, that Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſaies ſo clearly in theſe termes, <hi>That, there ſhould be no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the purity of thoſe who receive Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt, and that of the bleſſed Saints, but as much as there is between Faith and the beatifical viſion of God, on which alone depend the different manners wherein he is eaten on earth and in heaven.</hi> You ſhould, Fathers, have had a reverence for the ſacred truths in theſe words, rather then corrupted them, to find in them an hereſie they are incapable of, which is, that Jeſus Chriſt is onely eaten by faith, and not by the mouth, as your Fathers <hi>Annat,</hi> and <hi>Meynier</hi> malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affirme, making it the principal head of their accuſation.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, Fathers, how little you are beholden to proof; and therefore you are forc'd to flie to a new artifice which is to falſifie the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo to bring it about that Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> ſhould not be conformable thereto: ſo many waies are you furniſh'd with to make people <hi>heretical.</hi> And this is done by your Father <hi>Meynier</hi> in no leſs then fiftie places of his book, and eight or ten times in the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115411:220"/> ſingle <hi>pag.</hi> 54. where he pretends, that for a man to expreſs himſelf like a true Catholick, it is not enough to ſay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt is really preſent in the Euchariſt; but that he muſt ſay, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> WITH THE COUNCIL <hi>that he is preſent therein by a true</hi> LOCAL PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENCE, <hi>or locally.</hi> And thereupon he cites the Council <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 13. <hi>can.</hi> 3. <hi>can.</hi> 4. <hi>can.</hi> 6. Who would not think, when he ſaw the words <hi>Local preſence</hi> cited out of three Canons of an Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but that thoſe words were to be found there? This might have ſerv'd your turn before my XV. <hi>Letter</hi> was abroad, but now, Fathers, people are not ſo eaſily caught in that ſnare. We conſult the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and find that you are <hi>Impoſtors.</hi> For theſe termes of <hi>Local preſence, locally, loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> never were there. And I tell you further, Fathers, that they are not in any other place of that Council, nor in any other Council before it, nor in any Father of the Church. I would therefore deſire you to tell me, whether you pretend to faſten the ſuſpicion of <hi>Calviniſme</hi> on all thoſe who have not made uſe of that terme.

What foul play to impoſe them upon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels? And what ignorance not to know the difficulties which the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated Saints have made to receive them? Be aſhamed then, Fathers, of your
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:115411:221"/> 
                  <hi>ignorant impoſtures,</hi> as the Scripture ſayes to ſuch ignorant impoſtors as you are: <hi>Be aſhammed of whoredome before father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; be aſhamed of lies before the Prince and men in Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not pretend to play the Maſters any more: you have neither the character nor the abilities to be ſuch. But if you will make your propoſitions with more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, you will haply be heard. For though this word, <hi>Local preſence,</hi> was rejected by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> as you have ſeen, becauſe the body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt in the ordinary extent of bodies in their places; yet hath this term been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by ſome late Authors of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as onely underſtanding thereby, that the body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is truly under the ſpecies, which being in a particular place, the body of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> is there alſo. And in this ſenſe, M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> will make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to admit it, ſince that M. de Saint <hi>Cyran</hi> and he have declared ſo often, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Euchariſt is truly in a particular place, and miraculouſly in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at the ſame time. So that all your purifying of expreſſions comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo you have not been able to give the leaſt likelyhood to an accuſation,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:115411:221"/> which it ſhould not have been lawfull to advance without pregnant and undeniable proofes.</p>
               <p>But to what end is it, Fathers, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their innocence to your calumnies? you do not charge them with theſe errours out of any belief that they maintain them, but out of a belief that they prejudice you. There needs no more, according to your Theologie, to calumniate them without being guilty of any crime in ſo doing, and you may without any confeſſion or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance celebrate the maſſe at the ſame time that you charge Prieſts, who ſay it every day, with a belief that it is pure Idolatry, which certainly were ſo horrid a piece of ſacriledge, that you your ſelves cauſed your own Father <hi>Jarrigius</hi> to be hanged <hi>in effigie,</hi> becauſe he had ſaid maſſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time <hi>he held correspondence with G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I cannot therefore but ſtand amazed, not that you with ſo little remorſe impoſe upon them crimes that are both ſo hainous and withall ſo falſe; but that you impoſe upon them, with ſo little prudence, crimes that have in themſelves ſo little probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For you do indeed diſpoſe of ſinnes, at your pleaſure, but do you imagine you
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:115411:222"/> ſhall accordingly diſpoſe of mens belief? Certainly, Fathers, were it neceſſary that the imputation of <hi>Calviniſme</hi> muſt fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon them or upon you, I ſhould find you in a very ſad condition. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are as Catholick as yours, but their carriage confirmes their faith, yours is diſconſonant to yours. For did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as they do, that bread to be really changed into the body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> why do you not, as they do, require that the ſtony and icy hearts of thoſe whom you adviſe to approch it ſhould be ſincerely converted into fleſhly and affectionate hearts? If you believe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be there under a qualification of death, to teach thoſe that approch it to dye to ſinne, the world, and themſelves, why do you admit thoſe to come neere it in whom vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſinfull paſſions are ſtill living and predominant? And how can you account thoſe worthy to eat the bread of heaven, who deſerve not to eate that of earth?</p>
               <p>O what a tranſcendent veneration have they for this ſacred Myſterie, who imploy their zeal to perſecute thoſe that honour it by ſo many holy communions, and to flatter ſuch as diſhonour it by ſo many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious communions! How does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Is it not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding worthy thoſe who practiſe this <hi>through all the earth,</hi> according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved maximes of their own <hi>General</hi> to charge the Author of the book of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion,</hi> and the <hi>Nunnes</hi> of the Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But who will not be ſurprized at the blindneſſe of your proceedings?

Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it your ſelves, wretches as you are? But to what extremities are you reduced, ſince that you muſt of neceſſitie either make good this charge, or paſſe for the lowdeſt Detractors that ever were? Prove it, then, Fathers; name that <hi>Eccleſiaſtick of good worth</hi> which you ſay was preſent at, and one of that aſſembly of <hi>Burg-fontain,</hi> in the yeare 1621. and had diſcovered, to your friend <hi>Filleau,</hi> the deſign then and there undertaken to ruine Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

Name him <hi>Who is meant by theſe Letters</hi> A.A. who, you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. <hi>is not Anthony A nauld,</hi> becauſe he hath convinced you that he was not then nine yeares of age, <hi>but another who is yet alive, and is too much a friend to Monſieur Arnauld, to be unknown to him.</hi> It ſeemes then, you know him, Fathers, and conſequently, if you have any the leaſt reſpect for Religion, you are obliged
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:115411:224"/> to make diſcoverie of this impious wretch to the King and Parliament, that he may be puniſhed according to his demerits. You muſt ſpeak freely, Fathers; you muſt name him, or expect the confuſion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being looked on hereafter otherwiſe then as infamous Lyars and ſycophants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ever to be credited. Tis in this manner, that the good Father <hi>Valerian</hi> hath taught us, that ſuch Impoſtors are <hi>to be racked</hi> and put to their utmoſt ſhifts. Your ſilence hereupon will be a full and abſolute conviction that this is nothing but a diabolicall Calumnie.

Barbarous and baſe Perſecutors! are not the moſt retired monaſteries San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries againſt your calumnies? While theſe ſacred Virgins do, day and night, adore <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to their inſtitution, you ceaſe not, day and night, from publiſhing it abroad, that they believe him not to be either in the Euchariſt, or yet at the right hand of his Father: and you publickly cut them off from being members of the Church, even while they are ſecretly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you and the whole Church. You traduce thoſe who have neither eares to heare you, nor tongue to anſwer you. But <hi>Jeſus Chr ſt,</hi> in whom they are hidden, ſo not to appeare but with him, heares you and anſwers for them. This day is that holy and terrible voice heard, which ſtartles Nature, and comforts the Church. And it is to be doubted Fathers, that thoſe who harden their hearts, and oſtinately
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:115411:225"/> refuſe to heare him when he ſpeaks as a God, will be forced to heare him with confuſion, when he ſhall ſpeak to them as a judge?</p>
               <p>For, in a word, Fathers, what account will you be able to give him of ſo many <hi>calumnies,</hi> when he ſhall examine them, not according to the fantaſticall imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your Fathers <hi>Dicaſtillus, Gans</hi> and <hi>Pennaloſſa,</hi> but according to the rules of his eternall truth, and by the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of his Church, which is ſo far from palliating or excuſing that crime, that ſhe not onely abhors it, but hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it in the ſame manner as voluntary <hi>homicide.</hi> For ſhe hath ſuſpended calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators as well as murtherers from the Communion till the houre of death by the I. and II. Councell of <hi>Arles.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Lateran</hi> thought thoſe unworthy to be received ino the Eccleſiaſticall State, who were convicted thereof, though they were reformed of it. Some Popes have threatned thoſe who had calumniated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts or Deacons, to be denyed the Communion at their death. And the Authors of a ſcandalous Libel, who could not prove what they had advanced, were by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> condemned <hi>to be whipped;</hi>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:115411:225"/> note Reverend Fathers, <hi>flagellentur.</hi> So far hath the Church ever been from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of your Society; which is grown ſo corrupt, as to excuſe crimes, great as that of <hi>Calumny,</hi> that you may commit them with more impunity.</p>
               <p>No doubt, Fathers, but you might by this means, do abundance of miſchief in the world, if God had not ſo ordered it, that you your ſelves ſhould furniſh the means to prevent it, and to render all your calumnies ineffectuall. For there's no more to be done then to diſcover this ſtrange maxime that exempts them from crime, to deprive you of all credit thereby: Calumny is unprofitable if there be not joyned with it a great reputation of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. A detractor can never compaſſe his ends, if he be not thought to abhorre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, as a crime he is uncapable of. And ſo, Fathers, your own principle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies you. You have eſtabliſhed it for the ſecurity of your Conſcience. For you would detract, and yet not be damned, but be of the number of thoſe holy and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calumniators, of whom Saint <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius ſpeakes.</hi> You have therefore, to keep your ſelves out of hell, embraced this maxime, which indeed keeps you out as
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:115411:226"/> far as the credit of your Doctors can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you? but the very ſame maxime, which, according to them, frees you from the evils you feare in the other life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives you, in this, of the advantages you expected to make of it. So that while you endeavour to avoid the vice of Detraction, you loſe the benefit of it, ſo contrary is evil to it ſelfe, and ſo is it ravelled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to it ſelfe by its own malice.</p>
               <p>You might calumniate with much more advantage to your ſelves, ſhould you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to affirme with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> that ſimple evil-ſpeakers, <hi>maledici,</hi> are unworthy to ſee God, ſince that your calumnies would thereby be the more credited, though, the truth known, you would condemne your ſelves: but when you ſay, as you do, that calumnie againſt your enemies is no crime, your reproches will not be believed, and yet you will nevertheleſſe be damned. For Fathers, there's nothing ſo certain, as that your grave Authors can neither abrogate the juſtice of God, nor you give a greater demonſtration of your not remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the truth, then that you make lies your refuge. If truth were of your ſide, the would fight for you; ſhe would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for you; and what enemies ſoever
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:115411:226"/> you had, <hi>Truth would deliver you out of their hands,</hi> according to her promiſe. You have not recourſe to lying, but to maintain the errours wherein you flatter the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of this world, and to keep up the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies whereby you oppreſſe thoſe godly people who oppoſe them. Truth being contrary to your deſignes, it was requiſite you <hi>put your truſt in lies,</hi> as the Prophet ſayes. <hi>Becauſe you have ſaid, we have made a Covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; though a ſcourge run over and paſſe through, it ſhall not come at us; for we have made falſhood our refuge, and under vanity are we hid.</hi> But what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer does the Prophet make them? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you deſpiſe this word, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uſt in oppreſſion and perverſeneſſe, and stay thereon; therefore this iniquity ſhall be to you as a breach ready to fall, ſwelling out in a high wall, whoſe breaking cometh ſuddenly at an inſtant. And he ſhall break it as the breaking of the Potters veſſel that is broken in pieces, he ſhall not spare: ſo that there ſhall not be found in the burſting of it, a ſherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withall out of the pit. Becauſe,</hi> as another Prophet ſaies, <hi>with lyes ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:115411:227"/> made ſad: and ſtrengthened the hand of the wicked that he ſhould not return from his wicked way, by promiſing him life. I will therefore deliver my peopl out of your hand, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt therefore needs hope, Fathers, that, if you do not reform, he will take out of your hands thoſe that you have ſo long deceived, either by ſuffering them to continue in their diſorders through your ill conduct, or by poyſoning them with your calumnies. He will raiſe in ſome an apprehenſion that the erroneous rules of your Caſuiſts will not ſecure them from his indignation; and will engrave in the minds of others a juſt fear of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for hearing you, and giving credit to your impoſtures, as you deſtroy your ſelves by inventing them, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them about the world. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit any thing of circumvention: God is not mocked, and no man ſhall, without being accomptable therefore, break the commandment he hath given us in the Goſpel, of not condemning our neighbour, till we are well aſſured that he is guiltie. And therefore, what profeſſions ſoever they may make of Godlineſs who are ſo ready to entertain your forgeries,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:115411:227"/> and under what pretence ſoever of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they may do it, they may well fear being ſhut out of the Kingdome of Heaven, for that onely ſin of having attributed ſuch enormous crimes as thoſe of hereſie and ſchiſme, to the charge of Catholick Prieſts and Religious Women, without any other proofs then ſuch palpable impoſtures as yours are. <hi>The Devil,</hi> ſaies <hi>Sales,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Geneva, is upon the tongue of the evil-ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and in the ear of him that hearkeneth to him.</hi> And <hi>Detraction,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> Cant. 24. <hi>is a poiſon which mortifies charity both in the one and the other. So that one ſingle calumny may prove mortal to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of ſouls; ſince it deſtroies, not onely thoſe that divulge, but alſo all thoſe that do not renounce it.</hi>

               <p>YOur late proceeding had brought me into a kind of belief that you would have been glad both ſides had given over and ſate ſtill, and I was willing it ſhould be ſo. But you have ſince ſpawn'd ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny writings in a ſhort time, that it ſeems there's no great certaintie of a peace when it depends on the ſilence of the Jeſuits.

               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:115411:229"/>
               <p>It is indeed time, that once for all I give an unavoidable check to the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you take to treat me as an Heretick, which grows ſtronger and ſtronger in you every day. You are ſo far guiltie of it in the book laſt publiſhed by you, that it is not to be ſuffered, and I might well incur the ſuſpicion of it, ſhould I not make ſuch an anſwer thereto as a reproch of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſerves. I had ſlighted this injurie in the writings of ſome others of your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, as well as many others which they had ſhuffled into them with it. My XV. Letter had anſwer'd them ſufficiently; but you ſpeak of it now after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; you very earneſtly make it the maine head of your vindication: 'tis in a manner the onely thing you have to alledge for your ſelves. For you ſay, <hi>That for a final anſwer to my</hi> XV. LETTERS, <hi>it is enough to ſay</hi> 15 <hi>times, that I am an Heretick, and that being declar'd ſuch, I do not deſerve any credit to be given me.</hi> So that you make my Ap ſtaſie to be out of all controverſie, ſuppoſing it as an undeniable principle, upon which you build ſo confidently. 'Tis therefore in good earneſt that you treat me as an heretick, and it is therefore in as good earneſt that I anſwer you thereto.</p>

               <p>You know, Father, that a charge of this nature is of ſuch conſequence, that it is an inſupportable temeritie to put it in againſt any man if it cannot be fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. I therefore deſire you to produce your evidence. When was I ſeen at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton?</hi> When have I neglected coming to Maſs, and doing thoſe duties which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are oblig'd to in their practiſes? When did I any action arguing the leaſt compliance with Hereticks, or ſchiſme in the Church? What Council have I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted? What conſtitution of the Pope have I violated? Anſwer muſt be made to theſe queſtions, or — you know what I would ſay. And what anſwer do you make? I entreat all the world to obſerve. You ſuppoſe in the firſt place, <hi>That he who writ the</hi> LETTERS <hi>hath ſome relation to Port-Royal.</hi> Then you aſſume, <hi>That Port-Royal hath been declared heretical,</hi> and thence conclude, <hi>that he who writ the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is declared an Heretick.</hi> This kind of accuſation reflects not on me at all, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but onely on <hi>Port Royal,</hi> and you charge me with it no further then you ſuppoſe me to relate to that place. So that I ſhall have no hard task to vindicate my ſelf, ſince I need do no more then tell
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:115411:230"/> you, that I am not of that place; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to my Letters, where I have ſaid <hi>that I am alone,</hi> and in expreſs termes, that <hi>I am not of Port-Royal,</hi> as I have done in my XVI. Letter, which came abroad immediately before your book.</p>
               <p>You muſt then take ſome other courſe to prove me an Heretick, or you betray your weakneſs to all the world. Prove then by my writings, that I ſubmit not to the <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> I have not written ſo much: there are onely XVI. LETTERS to be examined, in all which I defie you, nay all the world, to find the leaſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion tending to any ſuch thing. But I can ſhew you in them the quite contrary. For when I ſaid for inſtance, in the XIV. <hi>that a man killing, accord ng to your Maximes, one of his brethren in mortal ſin, damnes him for whom Jeſus Chriſt died,</hi> do I not evidently acknowledge that Jeſus Chriſt died for that damned ſoul? and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is falſe, <hi>That he died onely for the Predeſtinate;</hi> which is that that is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt Propoſition. It is therefore clear, Fathers, that I have not ſaid any thing, whence it might be thought I aſſert thoſe impious propoſitions, which I deteſt with all my ſoul. And though <hi>Port-Royal</hi>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:115411:230"/> ſhould maintain them, you cannot thence infer any thing againſt me, becauſe, I have not, I praiſe God, any dependence ſave that on the holy <hi>Catholick, Apoſtolick,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Church, wherein I am reſolved to live and die, in communion with the Pope the ſoveraign head thereof, out of which I am perſwaded there is no ſalvation.</p>
               <p>What courſe can you take with a perſon that talkes after this rate, and which way do you intend to ſet upon me, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my diſcourſes nor my writings afford you the leaſt occaſion to charge me with hereſie, and that I find my ſafetie againſt your menaces in my own obſcuritie? You find your ſelves wounded by an inviſible hand which makes your extravagances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all the world. And you vainly aſſault me in the perſons of thoſe with whom you imagine me to be in union. I fear you not, either out of any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſelf or any other, as having no relation to any Communitie, nor to any perſon whatſoever. All the credit you can make amounts to nothing as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me. I hope not any thing from the world, nor do I fear any thing from it; nor do I deſire any of it; having the grace and aſſiſtance of God, I neither want
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:115411:231"/> wealth, nor any mans Authoritie. So that I can elude all your attempts; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faſten on me, endeavour it which way you pleaſe. You may have ſomething to ſay to <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> but nothing to me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been turn'd out of <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You may well prepare your violent remedies againſt Prieſts and Doctors, but not againſt me who can pretend to no ſuch qualities. And ſo perhaps, you never before had to do with a perſon that ſtood ſo much in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of your attempts, and ſo fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage againſt your Errours, as being free, without engagement, without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without obligation, without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not medling with affairs, one ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acquainted with your Maximes, and fully reſolv'd to put them forward as far as I ſhall find God encouraging me to do it, ſo that no worldly conſideration ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard or take off the edge of my proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>What advantage is it to you, Father, when you can do nothing againſt me, to divulge ſo many calumnies againſt perſons that are not concern'd in the d fference between us, as all your Fathers do? Theſe evaſions ſhall not ſerve your turn. You
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:115411:231"/> ſhall feel the weight of Truth which I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt you. I tell you, that you take away Chriſtian Moralitie by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it from the love of God, from which you give men a diſpenſation; and you tell me <hi>of the death of Father Meſter,</hi> a man I never ſaw in my life. I tell you that your Authors allow one man to kill another <hi>for an apple,</hi> when it is a ſhame to part with it, and you tell me that a <hi>Poor's-box hath been opened at Saint Merry.</hi> What do you mean, when you charge me daily with the book of <hi>Holy Virginity,</hi> made by an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Father, whom I never ſaw, no more then his book? I cannot but admire you, Father, when you thus conſider all that are different from you as one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual perſon. Your indignation graſps them altogether, and makes them as it were one body of Reprobates, whereof you would have every one anſwer for the reſt of his company.</p>
               <p>There is a vaſt difference between the Jeſuits and thoſe that oppoſe them. You do really make up one Body united under one Head, and your rules, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſcover'd, allow you not to print any thing without the approbation of your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, who by that means become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:115411:232"/> for the errours of every one of you in particular, ſo as that <hi>they cannot excuſe themſelves by ſaying that they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the errours taught therein, becauſe they ought to have obſerved them,</hi> according to your Ordinances, and according to the Letters of your Generalls, <hi>Aquaviva, Vitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leschi, &amp;c.</hi> It is therefore not unjuſtly that you are charged with the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of thoſe of your fraternity that are found in their workes, when approved by your Superiours and by the Divines of your Society. But for my part, Fathers, the caſe is much otherwiſe. I have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the book of <hi>Holy Virginity.</hi> Though all the poore's boxes in <hi>Paris</hi> were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhould be never the leſſe a Catholick. In a word, I openly and clearly declare it to you, No man is to be reſponſible for my Letters but my ſelf, and I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for any thing but my Letters.</p>
               <p>Here might I ſit ſtill, Father, and not ſay any thing of thoſe other perſons whom you treat as hereticks, ſo to exempt my ſelf from that charge. But ſince I am the occaſion of it, I think my ſelf, in ſome ſort obliged to lay hold of the ſame occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo as to make three advantages of it. For it is one conſiderable advantage to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:115411:232"/> cleare up the innocency of ſo many calu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mniated perſons. Tis another, and that very pertinent to my purpoſe, to diſcover ſtill the artifices of your Politicks in this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But that I look on as of moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, is, that I ſhall ſatisfie the world of the falſhood of that ſcandalous report which you ſcatter ſo much up and down, <hi>That the Church is divided by a new hereſy.</hi> And whereas you abuſe abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by making them believe that the points, upon which you endeavour to raiſe up ſo great a tempeſt, are eſſentiall to faith, I conceive it a buſineſſe of very great importance to deſtroy theſe falſe impreſſions, and clearly to explaine wherein they conſiſt, ſo to make it really appeare that there are no Hereticks in the Church.</p>
               <p>For it is not true that if it be demanded, wherein conſiſts the hereſy of thoſe whom you call <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> it will be preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it is for that they affirme, <hi>That the Commandements of God are impoſſible to be obſerved: That Grace cannot be reſisted; and that a man is not at liberty to do good and evil: That</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>dyed not for all men, but onely for the predeſtinate, and in a word for that they maintain the five Propoſitions
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:115411:233"/> condemned by the Pope.</hi> Is it not upon this account you would have the world believe that you perſecute your adverſaries? Is not this that you aſſert in your bookes, in your diſcourſes, in your Catechiſme, as you did at Chriſtmas laſt, at Saint <hi>Lewis's,</hi> when asking one of your little ſhepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, <hi>For whom came</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>into the World, ſweet-heart? For all men, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> replyes ſhe. <hi>How then, ſweet-heart, it ſeems you are not one of theſe new Hereticks who affirmt he is come onely for the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?</hi> Upon this do children believe you, and with them diverſe others; for you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with the very ſame fables in your Sermons, as your Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> did to <hi>Orleance,</hi> for which reaſon he was ſuſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And I muſt acknowledge that I have ſometimes believed you. You had given me the ſame repreſentation of all thoſe perſons. So that when you began to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of maintaining theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I very attentively obſerved what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer they would make; and I was much reſolved never to ſee them again, if they ſhould not have declared that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them as evident impieties. But they did it much more loudly. For Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Saint Beaue</hi> King's Profeſſor in

Propoſitions long before the Pope; and thoſe Doctors put out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe treatiſes, and among others that of <hi>Victorious Grace,</hi> which they produced at the ſame time, wherein they renounce thoſe propoſitions both as heretical and as new. For they ſay in the preface, <hi>That thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are hereticall and Lutheran, foyſted and advanced at pleaſure, ſuch as were not in</hi> Janſenius <hi>nor his defenders;</hi> theſe are their expreſſions. They take it ill that they are fathered on them, and thereupon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to you theſe words of Saint <hi>Proſper,</hi> the firſt diſciple of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> their Maſter, to whom the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> in France attributed the like, purpoſely to make him odious. <hi>There are ſome,</hi> ſayes this Saint, <hi>who are hurried on by ſo blind a paſſion to diſcredit us that they have taken a courſe that ruines their own reputation. For they have out of deſign foyſted certain propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions fraught with Impieties and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which they ſcatter into all parts, to make men believe that we maintain them in the ſame ſenſe that they expreſſe in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. But the world ſhall ſee by this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, both our innocence, and the malice of thoſe who have charged us with theſe
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:115411:234"/> mpieties, whereof they are the onely inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt needs confeſſe, Father, when I heard them ſpeak to this effect before the Conſtitution; when I ſaw them receive it afterwards with all poſſible reſpect; that they offered to ſubſcribe it; and that Monſieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> had declared all this more expreſly then I can alledge it, throughout his ſecond Letter, I ſhould have thought it a ſinne to doubt of their faith. And accordingly thoſe who would have denyed their friends abſolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Monſieur <hi>Arnauld's</hi> letter came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, have ſince declar'd, that after he had ſo clearly condemned the errors lay'd to his charge, there was no reaſon, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or any of his friends ſhould be cut off from being members of the Church. But your proceeding hath been otherwiſe; which gave me firſt occaſion to miſtruſt that you were not free from paſſion.</p>
               <p>For whereas you had threatned to make them ſign that Conſtitution when you thought they would have oppoſed it, when you ſaw they were inclinable thereto of themſelves, you let the buſineſſe fall to the ground. And though it might have been expected that you ſhould afterwards
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:115411:234"/> have been ſatisfyed with their carriage, yet muſt you needs treat them ſtill as hereticks, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaid you, <hi>there was a diſconſonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy between their hearts and their hands, and that they were Catholicks externally and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks internally,</hi> as you have expreſſed your ſelves in your Anſwer to certain Queſtions, <hi>p.</hi> 27. and 47.</p>
               <p>What a ſtrange proceeding did this ſeem to me, Father! For what man is there of whom there might not as much be ſaid? And what diſturbances might not ſuch a pretence as this raiſe? <hi>If a man refuſe,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, <hi>to believe their confeſſion whoſe faith is conformable to the ſentiments of the Church he brings the faith of all Catholicks in queſtion.</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was in ſome doubt, Father, <hi>that it was your deſign to make theſe perſons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, though they were not ſuch,</hi> as the ſame Pope ſayes, upon a diſpute of the like nature in his time, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is not to oppoſe hereſies, but to make a hereſy, to refuſe to believe thoſe who by their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion make it appeare that they are in the true faith: Hoc non eſt haereſim purgare, ſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> But I was convinced that in effect there were no hereticks in the Church, when I ſaw they had ſo well cleared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:115411:235"/> from all theſe hereſies: that you were not able to charge them with any errour contrary to faith: and that you were reduced to that extremity, as to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with them onely about queſtions <hi>of fact,</hi> concerning <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which could not be matter of hereſie. For you would oblige them to acknowledge that theſe propoſitions were in <hi>Janſenius, word, for word, wholly and in expreſſe termes,</hi> as you have it; <hi>Singulares, individuae, totidem verbis apud Janſenium contentae,</hi> in your <hi>Cavilli, p.</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>From that time I looked on the Diſpute between you with much indifference. While I thought you diſputed about the truth or falſity of the Propoſitions, I heard you with attention, for ſo far it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned matter <hi>of Faith:</hi> But when I ſaw that the buſineſſe in controverſie was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know whether they were <hi>word for word in Janſenius,</hi> there being no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion in it, I troubled not my ſelf any further with it. Not but that it might be very likely you ſpoke truth; for to ſay that ſuch a ſentence is <hi>word for word</hi> in an Author, it's a thing not much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to miſtake. And for that reaſon can I not much wonder that ſo many perſons,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115411:235"/> both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould, upon an expreſſion ſo free from ſuſpicion, be perſwaded that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had really main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them. But it muſt withall needs adde to my aſtoniſhment, when I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that even that very matter <hi>of fact,</hi> which you had propoſed as ſo certain, and of ſuch conſequence, was falſe, and that you were defyed to cite the pages of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> where you had found thoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions <hi>word for word;</hi> which yet you were never able to do.</p>
               <p>I will give you an account of the whole proceeding, becauſe, methinkes, it very much diſcovers the ſpirit of your Society in all this Affaire, and that men muſt needs wonder, to ſee, that notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, you have not forborn to give out that they are ſtill hereticks: but you have onely changed their hereſy according to time. For proportionably to their vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of themſelves from one hereſy, your Fathers ſtill faſtened another on them, to the end they might never be free. Thus in the yeare 1653. their hereſy was about the <hi>quality</hi> of the Propoſitions. Thence it was tranſlated to the <hi>word for word.</hi> Then you brought it into the <hi>heart.</hi> But now all this is vaniſhed, and they muſt
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115411:236"/> needs be hereticks, if they will not give it under their <hi>hands, That the ſenſe of the Doctrine of</hi> Janſenius <hi>is included in the ſenſe of the five Propoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſubject of your preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. You are not ſatisfyed that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the five Propoſitions, and, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, whatever <hi>Janſenius</hi> muſt contain that were conformable thereto, and contrary to Saint <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> for all this they do. So that the queſtion is not, for inſtance, to know <hi>whether Jeſus Ch iſt dyed onely for the Predeſtinate,</hi> that they condemn as well as you, but whether <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> be of that opinion or no. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ground, it is that I declare to you more freely then ever, that I value your diſpute little ſince the Church is not much concerned in it. For though I am no more Doctor then you are, Father, yet can I well perceive there is not any matter of Faith in it, ſince the onely queſtion is to know the judgement of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Did they believe that his Doctrine were conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the genuine and literall ſenſe of thoſe propoſitions; they would condemn it; and they refuſe not to do it but out of a perſwaſion that it is very much different from it; and ſo though they ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:115411:236"/> it, they were not therefore he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſince they underſtand it onely in a Catholick ſenſe.</p>
               <p>To cleare up the buſineſſe by an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I will inſtance in that diverſity of ſentiments which happened between Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> and Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> concerning the writings of Saint <hi>Denys</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherein Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> thinking he had met with ſomewhat of the ſenſe of <hi>Arius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the co-equality of the Father and the Son, he condemned them as hereticall. Saint <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> on the contrary, thinking they contained onely the true ſenſe of the Church, maintained them as Catholick. Do you think, Fathers, that Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> who held theſe writings to be <hi>Arian,</hi> had any right to treat Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> as a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick becauſe he maintained them? And what reaſon ſhould he have had to do ſo, ſince it was not the <hi>Arianiſme</hi> that he maintained therein, but the true faith which he thought they contained? If theſe two Saints had agreed about the true ſenſe of theſe writings, and that they had both diſcovered that hereſy in them, Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> could not certainly have maintained them without hereſy: but ſince they differed about the ſenſe, Saint
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:115411:237"/> 
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was Catholick in maintaining them, even though he miſ-underſtood them, ſince it would have been onely an errour <hi>of fact,</hi> and that he maintained not any thing in that doctrine but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith which he ſuppoſed had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>This, Father, I apply to you; were you agreed about the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and ſhould they grant you that he holds, for inſtance, <hi>that grace cannot be reſiſted,</hi> thoſe that ſhould refuſe to condemn him were hereticks. But when you are in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the ſenſe, and they think that according to his doctrine <hi>grace may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,</hi> there is no reaſon you ſhould rreat them as hereticks, what hereſy ſoever you may your ſelves attribute to him, ſince they condemn the ſenſe you ſuppoſe to be therein, and you dare not condemn the ſenſe they ſuppoſe therein. If therefore you would convince them; make it appeare that the ſenſe they attribute to <hi>Janſenius</hi> is hereticall; for, in that caſe, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will be ſuch. But how can you make them ſo, when it is evident, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own acknowledgement, that the ſenſe they give him is not condemned?</p>
               <p>To make the buſineſſe yet more cleare,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115411:237"/> I ſhall take for a principle that which you will grant to be ſuch your ſelves, <hi>that the doctrine of efficacious Grace hath not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and that the Pope hath not medled with it in his Constitution.</hi> And in effect, when he would judge of the V. Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the point of efficacious was put out of all hazard of cenſure. This appears clearly by the judgement of the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to whoſe examination the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the buſineſſe. Theſe judgements I have in my hands, as well as diverſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Paris,</hi> and among the reſt, my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> who brought them from <hi>Rome.</hi> There we find that they were divided in their opinions, and that the moſt eminent among them, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Sacred Palace, the Commiſſary of the holy office, the generall of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine Friers, and others, conceiving that thoſe propoſitions might be taken in the ſenſe of efficacious grace, were of opinion that they ought not to he cenſured; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the reſt granting that they ought not to be cenſured if they had had that ſenſe, yet thought they ſhould be cenſured; for that, according to what they declare, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and naturall ſenſe was far from it. And thereupon the Pope condemned
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:115411:238"/> them, and the world hath ſubmitted to his judgement.</p>
               <p>It is therefore certain Father, that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious grace hath not been condemned. And indeed it is ſo vigorouſly maintained by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> by Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and all his School, by ſo many Popes and Councells, and by univerſall <hi>Tradition,</hi> that it were impiety to charge it with hereſy, Now all thoſe that you treat as Hereticks declare that they find not any thing in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> but that doctrine of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious grace. And this is the onely thing they maintain at <hi>Rome.</hi> You have acknowledged it your ſelf <hi>Cavil. p.</hi> 35. where you have declared, <hi>that ſpeaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope, they ſaid not a word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ne verbum quidem; and that they spent the whole time in diſcourſing of efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace.</hi> And ſo whether they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or not in this ſuppoſition, thus much is at leaſt cleare, that the ſenſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not hereticall, and conſequently they are no hereticks. For to cut the knot in a word: either <hi>Janſenius</hi> hath not taught any thing but efficacious grace, or he hath taught ſomething elſe: in the former caſe he is charged with no errours; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he hath no compurgators. All the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:115411:238"/> then, is to know whether <hi>Janſenius</hi> hath taught any thing in effect beſides ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious grace, and if it be found that he hath, you ſhall have the reputation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood him beſt; but they ſhall not be ſo unfortunate as to have err'd in matters of faith.</p>
               <p>We are therefore to give God the praiſe, Father, that in effect, there is no hereſy in the Church, ſince that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in agitation concernes onely matter of fact, whence there cannot any iſſue. For the Church decides points of <hi>Faith,</hi> with a divine authority, and ſhe cuts off all thoſe that refuſe to embrace them: but ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds otherwiſe in matters <hi>of fact.</hi> And the reaſon of it is, that our Salvation is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to the faith that hath been revealed to us, and is preſerved in the Church by Tradition; but it hath not any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on other particular matters of fact which have not been revealed from God. Thus is a man obliged to believe that it is not impoſſible to keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but is not obliged to know what <hi>Janſenius</hi> hath taught upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. God therefore, in the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of points <hi>of faith</hi> guides the Church by the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit which cannot
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:115411:239"/> erre; whereas in matters <hi>of fact,</hi> he leaves her to ſence and reaſon the natural judges thereof. For it is God only that can inſtruct the Church in matters of Faith; but there needs no more then to read <hi>Janſenius,</hi> to know whether ſuch and ſuch propoſitions be in his book. And thence it comes that it is hereſie to oppoſe deciſions of faith; becauſe it is the oppoſition of a mans own ſpirit to the ſpirit of God. But it is not hereſie, though it may haply be temeritie, not to believe certain particular matters of fact; becauſe it is no more then oppoſing Reaſon which may be clear, to an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that is great, but, in that, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>This is generally acknowledg'd by all Divines, as is apparent by this Maxime of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of your Societie; <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils legally conven'd cannot erre in defining articles of Faith, but they erre in queſtions of fact.</hi> And elſewhere; <hi>The Pope as Pope, though in the head of an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Council may erre in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies relating to matter of fact, ſuch as principally depend upon information and the depoſition of witneſſes.</hi> And Cardinal <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> in like manner; <hi>We muſt abſolutely ſubmit to General Councils in point of Fai h;

               <p>I thought it not amiſs, Father, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome you to thoſe contrarieties that happen among Catholicks upon queſtions of fact about the underſtanding the ſenſe of an Author, by giving you thereupon inſtances of one Father of the Church againſt another, of a Pope againſt a Pope, and of a Council againſt a Council, ſo to lead you by the hand to other examples of a like oppoſition, but more diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

               <p>You know, Father, that the writings of <hi>Origen</hi> have been condemn'd by divers Councils, and ſeveral Popes, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the fifth general Council, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining hereſie, and among others <hi>that of reconciliati n of the Devils at the day of Judgment.</hi> Do you think hereupon, that it is of abſolute neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If this be ſo, what will become of your Father <hi>Halloix,</hi> who hath maintain'd the puritie of <hi>Origens</hi> faith, as well as divers other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, who have undertaken the ſame thing, as <hi>Picus</hi> of <hi>Mirandala,</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Sorbonne?</hi> And is it not further certain that the ſame fifth general Council condemn'd the writings of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> againſt Saint <hi>Cyril,</hi> as <hi>impious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true faith, and containing the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian hereſie?</hi> and yet Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> a Jeſuit, hath not ſtuck to vindicate him, and to affirme, in the life of that Father, <hi>that thoſe very writings are free from that Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee then, Fathers, that when the Church condemns any writings, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in them ſome errour which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns; and then it is matter of faith that that errour is condemn'd: but it is not of faith, that thoſe writings contain, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the errour which the Church ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therein. I think this hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prov'd; and ſo I ſhall conclude theſe examples with that of Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> whereof the ſtorie is ſo well known. About the beginning of the ſeventh Age, the Church being in ſome diſturbance by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:115411:241"/> of the hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> this Pope, to determine the difference made a Decree which ſeem'd to favour thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſo that many were ſcandaliz'd at it. Yet the buſineſs was ſmother'd with little noiſe during the time of his Popedome: but about fiftie years after the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled together in the ſixth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Council, wherein Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> pre-preſided by his Legate, this decree was brought in thither, and after it was read and examin'd, condemn'd, as containing the hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> and, as ſuch, burnt in a full aſſembly, together with the other writings of thoſe Hereticks. And this deciſion was receiv'd with ſo much veneration and uniformitie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Church, that it was afterwards confirm'd by two other general Councils, nay by the Popes, <hi>Leo</hi> II. and <hi>Adrian</hi> II. who liv'd two hundred years after, no man offering to diſturb ſo univerſal and ſo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et a conformitie for the ſpace of ſeven or eight Ages. And yet ſome Authors of theſe late times, and among others Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> were not in any jealouſie of being thought Hereticks, though they maintain'd againſt ſo many Popes and Councils, <hi>that the writings of</hi> Honorius
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115411:242"/> 
                  <hi>were free from the errour which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have been therein; becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it being poſſible that general Councils may erre in questions of fact, we may confidently affirme that the ſixth Council was miſtaken in that particular fact, and that having not well underſtood the ſenſe of</hi> Honorius<hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they undeſervedly put that Pope into the Catalogue of Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray obſerve, Father, that a man runs not the hazard of being an Heretick, who affirmes that Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was not any, though divers Popes and ſeveral Councils had declar'd him ſuch, and that after examination of the buſineſs. I come then to our queſtion; and I give you leave to make your cauſe as good as you can. What will you ſay, Father, to make your adverſaries hereticks? <hi>That Pope</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent X. <hi>hath declared that the errour of the five propoſitions is in</hi> Janſenius? I allow you to ſay all that. What concluſion will you draw thence? <hi>That it is hereſie not to acknowledge that the errour of the five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions is in</hi> Janſenius? What think you of it Father? Is not this a plain queſtion <hi>of fact,</hi> of the ſame nature as the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? The Pope hath declar'd that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the five Propoſitions is in <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:115411:242"/> juſt as his predeceſſors had declar'd that the errours of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites</hi> were in the writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Honorius.</hi> Whereupon your Fathers have written, that they willingly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe hereſies, but are not ſatisfied that thoſe Authors did maintain them; in like manner do your adverſaries ſay now, that they do indeed condemn thoſe five propoſitions, but do not grant that <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ever taught them. Theſe caſes, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are certainly much of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if there be any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, it is eaſily perceived how much it makes for the advantage of the preſent queſtion by the compariſon of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular circumſtances, which being viſible of themſelves, I ſhall not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How comes it then, Father, that in the ſame caſe your Fathers are Catholicks and your Adverſaries hereticks? And by what ſtrange exception do you deprive them of a libertie which you allow all the reſt of the faithful?</p>
               <p>What will you ſay to this Father? <hi>That the Pope hath confirmed his Conſtitution by a Brief?</hi> I anſwer you, that two general Councils and two Popes have confirm'd the condemnation of <hi>Honorius</hi>'s Letters.
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:115411:243"/> But what force do you pretend to give the words of this Brief by which the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>That he hath condemn'd the doctrine of</hi> Janſenius <hi>in thoſe five Propoſitions?</hi> What does this add to the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and what may be inferr'd thence, but that as the VI. Council condemn'd the doctrine of <hi>Honorius,</hi> becauſe they believed it to be the ſame with that of the <hi>Monothelites;</hi> ſo the Pope ſaies, that he hath condemn'd the doctrine of <hi>Janſenius</hi> in thoſe five Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as ſuppoſing it to be the ſame with thoſe five Propoſitions. And indeed, how could he but believe it? Your Society pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes nothing elſe, and you your ſelf, Father, who have ſaid they were there <hi>word for word,</hi> were in <hi>Rome</hi> at the time of the Cenſure; for I meet with you every where. Could he have diſtruſted the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie or the abilities of ſo many grave Religious men? And how could he but believe that the doctrine of <hi>Janſenius</hi> was the ſame with that of the five Propoſitions, when he had your ſecuritie that they were <hi>word for word</hi> in that Author? It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident, Father, that if it happen <hi>Janſenius</hi> held them, we ſhall not need ſay, as your Fathers have done in their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that the Pope was deceiv'd in the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:115411:243"/> matter of fact, which to publiſh argues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the indiſcretion of the publiſher; but there need be no more ſaid then that you have deceiv'd the Pope, which implies nothing of ſcandall, you are now ſo well known to all.</p>
               <p>Thus, Father, is this matter far from being able to form an Hereſie. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your deſire to make it one at any rate, you have endeavour'd to turn the queſtion from matter <hi>of fact,</hi> to tranſlate it into a point <hi>of Faith.</hi> And that you do thus. <hi>The Pope,</hi> ſay you, <hi>declares that he hath condemn'd the doctrine of</hi> Janſenius <hi>in thoſe five Propoſitions: it is therefore of faith, that the doctrine of</hi> Janſenius <hi>concerning theſe five Propoſitions is Heretical, whatever it be.</hi> This, Father, is certainly a very ſtrange point of Faith, that a doctrine is heretical whatever it may be. What, if according to <hi>Janſenius</hi> a man <hi>may reſiſt the internal grace,</hi> and if it be falſe according to him <hi>that Jeſus Christ died onely for the predeſtinate,</hi> ſhall that alſo be condemn'd becauſe it is his doctrine? ſhall it be true in the Conſtitution of the Pope, <hi>that a man hath the liberty to do either good or evil,</hi> and ſhall it be falſe in <hi>Janſenius?</hi> By what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie muſt he be ſo unhappy that truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:115411:244"/> Heretical in his book? Muſt it not then be acknowledg'd that he is heretical onely in caſe he be conformable to theſe condemn'd errours, ſince the Popes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is the rule to which we muſt apply <hi>Janſenius,</hi> to judge of him according to the compliance there will be between them; and that this queſtion, <hi>viz. whether his doctrine be heretical,</hi> will be reſolv'd by this other queſtion of fact, <hi>viz. whether it be conformable to the genuine ſenſe of theſe propoſitions,</hi> it being impoſſible it ſhould not be heretical if it be conſonant thereto, and Catholick, if it be contrary thereto. For in fine, ſince that according to the Pope and the Biſhops, <hi>the Propoſitions are condemn'd in their proper and genuine ſenſe,</hi> it is impoſſible they ſhould be condemn'd in the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> unleſs it be in caſe the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi> be the ſame with the proper and genuine ſenſe of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which is matter <hi>of fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The queſtion therefore ſticks ſtill at <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact,</hi> ſo as that it cannot by any means be brought into matter <hi>of right,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it cannot be made matter of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</hi> But you might well make it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of perſecution, were there not ſome hope left, there will not any ſo far engage
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:115411:244"/> into your concernments, as to further ſo unjuſt a proceeding, &amp; be prevailed with to give it under their hands, as you would have it, that they condemn thoſe propoſitions in the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi> without explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what that ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is. There are few will be drawn in to ſign a blank confeſſion of faith. Now to ſign that, were to ſign ſuch a one, which you would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fill up with what you pleaſed, ſince you were at liberty to give what interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation you thought fit to that ſenſe of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> which had not been explained. Let it therefore be explained before hand; elſe you will put us off with a next power, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrahendo ab omni ſenſu.</hi> You know this does not do well in the world. There men hate ambiguity, eſpecially in matters of faith, where it is but juſt men ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand at leaſt what they condemn. And how could it come to paſſe, that Doctors who were perſwaded that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had no other ſenſe then that of efficacious grace, ſhould be drawn to declare that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his doctrine without explaining it, ſince that according to the judgement they have of it, and which they ſtill perſiſt in, it were onely to condemne efficacious grace, which cannot be done without
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:115411:245"/> crime? Were it not then a ſtrange Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny they ſhould be reduced to this wretched extremity, either of making themſelves guilty before God by ſigning that condemnation contrary to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or being treated as Hereticks if they refuſed?</p>
               <p>But all this is carryed on with myſterie; all your motions are politicall. I muſt needs diſcover why you would not explain this ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> I write meerly to betray your deſignes, and by ſuch diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to make them ineffectuall. I am therefore to acquaint thoſe that know it not, that it being your main concernment in this diſpute to keep up the reputation of the ſufficient grace maintained by your <hi>Molina,</hi> you cannot do it without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efficacious grace which is abſolutely oppoſite thereto. But ſeeing it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced at this day in <hi>Rome,</hi> and among all the moſt learned of the Church, being not able to oppoſe it in it ſelf, you have thought fit to aſſault it, ſo as it might not be perceived, under the name of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Hence was it neceſſary you ſhould endeavour the condemnation of <hi>Janſenius</hi> without being explained, and that to compaſſe your deſign you ſhould
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:115411:245"/> give out that his doctrine is not that of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious grace, that ſo it might be believed that one was condemned without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thence it comes that you now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade thoſe that are not acquainted with that Author, that it is ſo. Nay this you do in particular, Father, in <hi>Cavilli p.</hi> 23. by this ſubtle kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; <hi>The Pope hath condemned the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of</hi> Janſenius; <hi>but the Pope hath not condemned the doctrine of efficacious grace; the doctrine therefore of efficacious grace is different from that of Janſenius.</hi> Were this kind of argument concluſive; it might be ſhewn in like manner that <hi>Honorius</hi> and all thoſe that defend him are hereticks, thus. The VI. Councill hath condemned the doctrine of <hi>Honorius;</hi> But the Council hath not condemned the doctrine of the Church, the doctrine of <hi>Honorius</hi> therefore is different from that of the Church. All therefore that defend him are hereticks. It is evident that this concludes nothing; ſince the Pope hath onely condemned the doctrine of the five Propoſitions which he hath been perſwaded is that of <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it matters not, for you will not make uſe of this argument long. It will
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:115411:246"/> ſerve well enough, weak as it is, till you have made the advantage you intend of it. All the end you have in it is to draw in thoſe who would not condemn efficacious grace, to condemne <hi>Janſenius</hi> without any difficulty. When that is once done the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will be forgotten, and the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will remain, to the eternall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the condemnation of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> ſo that you will take occaſion to fall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon <hi>efficacious grace,</hi> by this more ſolid way of diſputation, which you will put into form when the time is come: <hi>The doctrine of Janſenius,</hi> will you ſay, <hi>was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the univerſall ſubſcriptions of the whole Church; but this doctrine is evidently the ſame with that of efficacious grace,</hi> and that you will eaſily prove; <hi>the doctrine therefore of efficacious grace hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned even by the acknowledgement of the defenders thereof.</hi> This is the reaſon why you propoſe the condemnation of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be ſigned without explaining it. This is the advantage you expect to make of theſe ſubſcriptions. But if your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries refuſe to ſign, you ſpread another net for them upon that refuſall. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving craftily riveted the queſtion of faith into that of fact, not permitting they
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:115411:246"/> ſhould be ſeparated, nor that they ſhould ſign one without the other, though they cannot ſubſcribe both together, yet will you give it out every where that they have refuſed both together. So that though, in effect, they onely refuſe to acknowledge that <hi>Janſenius</hi> hath maintained the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions they condemn, which can make no hereſie, you will confidently affirme that they have refuſed to condemn the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in themſelves, and that therein conſiſts their hereſie. And this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage will you make of their refuſall, which is no leſſe conſiderable then what you would have made of their conſent. So that if they appeale to the ſignations they ever fall into your ambuſhes, whether they ſign or do not ſign, and you will be ſavers on both ſides: ſo cunningly have you ſhuffled your cards, ſo as to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies winners, what ever may turn up trump.</p>
               <p>Ah Father, how intimately am I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you, and how am I troubled to ſee that God hath ſo far forſaken you as to ſuffer you to be ſo fortunate in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate a procedure! your happineſſe is is to be pityed, and cannot be envied but by thoſe who know not what true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:115411:247"/> is. Tis a kind of charity to oppoſe that felicity which you ſeek after in all this proceeding, ſince you ground it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on falſhood, and that it is your main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make one of theſe two falſities to be credited, viz. either that the Church hath condemned efficacious grace, or that thoſe that defend it maintain the five con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned errours. Be it known therefore to all the world, both that efficacious grace is not condemned according to your own confeſſion, and that no body maintains thoſe errours, that it may be evident to all, that thoſe who ſhould refuſe to ſign what you would have exacted from them, refuſe it not but by reaſon of the queſtion of fact; and that being ready to ſign that of faith, they cannot be hereticks for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall, ſince that it is indeed of faith that thoſe propoſitions are hereticall, but that it will never be of faith that they are <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius's.</hi> They are without error, that's ſufficient. Perhaps they interpret <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> over-favourably, but you haply do not interpret him favourably enough. That it ſhall not be my buſineſſe to diſcuſſe. This I am certain of that according to your maximes you believe you may without crime proclaim him a heretick contrary to
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:115411:247"/> your own knowledge, whereas according to theirs, they could not, without crime, ſay he is a Catholick, were they not perſwaded he is ſuch. They therefore infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you in ſincerity, Father, they have examined <hi>Janſenius</hi> better then you have; they are not leſſe intelligent then you are, they are conſequently as much to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited as you are. But come what will of this point of fact, they certainly are ſtill Catholicks; ſince that to be ſuch, it is not neceſſary to ſay that another is not: and that without laying errour at any mans door, it is fair if a man can but be clear of it himſelf.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>REVEREND FATHER,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is a long time ſince you have made it your buſineſs to find out ſome errour in your Adverſaries, but I am confident you will at laſt acknowledge, that there is not haply any thing more difficult then to make thoſe Hereticks, who not onely are not ſuch, but endeavour above all things to avoid being ſo. I have made it appear in my laſt LETTER, how many hereſies you have laid to their charge one in the neck of another, becauſe you could not meet with any one you could make good for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, inſomuch that all the refuge
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:115411:248"/> you had was to charge them with refuſing to condemn the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> which you would needs oblige them to condemn without any explication of what it is. It argues you extremely unfurniſh'd with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies to reproch them with, that you were reduc'd to that extremity. For, who ever heard talk of any hereſie that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expreſs? It was therefore a matter of ſo much the more eaſe to anſwer, by alledging, that if <hi>Ianſenius</hi> be free from all errours, there's no reaſon he ſhould be condemn'd, and that if he be guilty of any, you ought to diſcover them, that ſo men may be ſatisfied what is to be condemn'd. Yet this could you never be induc'd to do, but have onely made it your deſign to give your pretences ſome weight from certain <hi>Decrees,</hi> whence you could not derive any advantage, there being not in them the leaſt explication of the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> which they ſay was condemn'd in the five Propoſitions. Now this was not the way to determine your differences. Were all ſides agreed about the true ſenſe of <hi>Ianſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and were no longer in diſpute ſave to know whether the ſenſe be heretical or not; then the judgments who ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the ſenſe were heretical, would
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:115411:249"/> doubtleſs come to what were moſt materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the queſtion. But the great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie being to know what the ſenſe of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> is, ſome affirming they cannot ſee any thing in him but the ſenſe of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas:</hi> and others, that they find in him a ſenſe that is heret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which yet they do not expreſs, it is evident, that the <hi>Constitution</hi> which hath not a word concerning this difference, and onely condemns in general the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> without explaining it, does not decide any thing of what is in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon you have been told an hundred times that your difference re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding onely matter <hi>of fact,</hi> you would never have it determin'd but by declaring what you meant by the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> But this though you were ever extreme loath to condeſcend to, yet have I brought you to the ſtake in my XV. LETTER, where I make it appear it was not without myſterie, that you had made it ſo much your buſineſs to get that ſenſe condemn'd without any explication, and it was your deſign to make that indeterminate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation fall upon the doctrine of <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious grace;</hi> by diſcovering it to be no
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:115411:249"/> other then that of <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> which you would have found it no hard matter to do. This it was that put you into a neceſſitie of anſwering. For if you had ſtill ſtood out and refuſed to explicate that ſenſe, it would have been apparent to the leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſort of people that all your quarrel was againſt efficacious grace, which would have turned to your utter confuſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the veneration which the Church hath for a doctrine ſo holy.</p>
               <p>You therefore have thought your ſelves oblig'd to declare; and that you have but juſt done by anſwering my Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I had repreſented it to you, <hi>That if Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius had, as to the five propoſitions, any other ſenſe then that of efficacious grace, he had no compurgators; but that if he had no other ſenſe then that of efficacious grace, he was not chargeable with any errours.</hi> This you could not acknowledge, Father, but you think to ſave all with a diſtinction, thus, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>It is not ſufficient,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to juſtifie</hi> Janſenius, <hi>to affirm that he onely maintaines efficacious grace; for that may be held two manner of wayes. One is hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, according to</hi> Calvin, <hi>which conſiſts in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Will, mov'd by grace, hath not the power to reſiſt it; another orthodoxe,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:115411:250"/> according to the</hi> Thomiſts <hi>and the</hi> Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, <hi>which is grounded upon principles eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Councils, which is, that efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace does, by its own force, ſo govern the will, that the latter hath nevertheleſs a power ſtill left to reſiſt the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is eaſily granted you, Father, and you conclude ſaying, <hi>that</hi> Janſenius <hi>were a Catholick ſhould he maintain efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace according to the</hi> Thomiſts, <hi>but that he is an heretick becauſe he is contrary to the</hi> Thomiſts, <hi>and conformable to</hi> Calvin, <hi>who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the power of the will to reſiſt Grace.</hi> I ſhal not here, Father, examine this point of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> whether <hi>Ianſenius</hi> be really conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Calvin.</hi> It is enough for me that you ſtand upon it, and that now at length you are pleaſed to let us know that by the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius</hi> you have not underſtood any other then that of <hi>Calvin.</hi> And was this all, Father, that you would have ſaid? Was it onely the errour of <hi>Calvin</hi> which you would have had condemn'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius?</hi> Why did you not declare ſo much ſooner? You might have ſpar'd your ſelf abundance of pains. For, without either <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Briefs,</hi> all the world would have joyn'd with you in the condemnation of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:115411:250"/> How neceſſary wasiit to decleare things up thus, and what abundance of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties does it diſperſe! We were to ſeek, Father, what errour the Popes and Biſhops would have condemn'd under the name of the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius.</hi> The whole Church was extreamly at a loſs about it, and no body would take the pains to explicate it to us. You now do it, Father, you I ſay, whom all your partie looks upon as the principal and firſt mover in all your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and who know the myſterie of all this Intrigue. You tell us then that the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> is no other then that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> condemn'd by the Council. See, abundance of doubts reſolv'd! We are now ſatisfied that the errour which they made it ſo much their buſineſs to condemn under theſe termes of the <hi>ſenſe of Ianſenius,</hi> is no other then the ſenſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and conſequently, that we continue our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Decrees, by condemning with them that ſenſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which they would have condemn'd. We are no longer aſtoniſh'd to ſee there are Popes and ſome Biſhops ſo zealous againſt the ſenſe of <hi>Ianſenius.</hi> Alas! how ſhould they be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, Father, when they gave credit to thoſe who affirme publickly that ſenſe to be the ſame with <hi>Calvins?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:115411:251"/>
               <p>Take it then from me Father, that you have not any thing to object againſt your adverſaries, for that no queſtion but they deteſt what you ſo much deteſt. All I wonder at is, that you knew not ſo much, and that you have ſo little acquaintance with their Sentiments upon this matter, they having declared themſelves ſo often in the r workes. I am confident, were you better informed, it would trouble you, that you have not been inſtructed by a a ſpirit of peace in a doctrine ſo pure and ſo Chriſtian-like, which your paſſion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages you to oppoſe becauſe you do not know it. You would find, Father, that they do not onely hold that a man may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually reſiſt thoſe weak graces, which are called exciting or inefficacious graces, by not performing that good which they inſpire us with: but alſo that they as reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely maintain, againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> the power which the will hath to reſiſt grace even when efficacious and victorious, as, againſt <hi>Molina,</hi> the power of that grace over the will; being equally jealous of the truth of both theſe Tenents. They are but too well ſatisfyed, that man, of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath ever the power of ſinning and reſiſting grace, and that ever ſince his
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:115411:251"/> corruption he carryes about him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy leaven of concupiſcence which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſtrengthens that power: but that nevertheleſſe when it pleaſes God to touch him out of his mercy, he makes him do what he pleaſes, and act as he would have him, yet ſo as that the infallibility of Gods operation does not any way deſtroy the naturall liberty of man, by reaſon of the ſecret and admirable wayes whereby God works this change, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath ſo excellently well explicated with ſuch clearneſſe, as diſperſes all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary contradictions, which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of efficacious grace think there are between the ſoveraigne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of grace over the Free-will, and the power which the free-will hath to reſiſt grace. For according to this great Saint, whom Popes and the Church have aſſigned as a rule in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God changes the heart of man by a celeſtiall ſweetneſſe which he inſpires it with, and which, tranſcending the delights of the Fleſh, makes a man ſenſible on the one ſide, of his nothingneſſe and mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſcovering, on the other, the greatneſſe and eternity of God, conceive an averſion for the delights of ſinne ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:115411:252"/> him from the incorruptible good; and finding his greateſt enjoyment in God charming him, he is infallibly inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, of himſelf, by a motion abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free, abſolutely voluntary, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely loving, ſo that it were a pain and puniſhment to him to be divided from him. Not but that it is poſſible for him ſtill to eſtrange himſelf, and that he effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may do it if he will; but how ſhould he ſince his will muſt ever be inclined to that, which pleaſes it moſt; and that it is not taken with any thing ſo much at that time as that onely good which comprehends in it ſelf what ever elſe is good? <hi>Quod enim ampliùs nos delectat, ſecundum id operemur neceſſe eſt,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>And thus doth God diſpoſe of the free-will of man, without impoſing any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity upon him; and the free-will, which may at any time reſiſt Grace, but will not at all times do it, is inclined, as freely, as infallibly, to God, when he would draw it to him by the ſweetneſſe of his efficacious inſpirations.</p>
               <p>Theſe, Father, are the divine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which it is true that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt grace, contrary to the opinion of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin;</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:115411:252"/> and that, nevertheleſſe, as Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> VIII. ſaies, in his writing directed to the congregation <hi>de Auxiliis; God formes in us the motion of our will, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſes efficaciouſly of our hearts, by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power which his Majeſty hath over the wills of men, as well as over the reſt of the Creatures that are under heaven,</hi> according to S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is further according to theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that we act of our ſelves, whence it comes that we have <hi>merits,</hi> which are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours, contrary to the errour of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and that nevertheleſſe, God being the firſt principle of our actions, and doing in us what is good and acceptable in his ſight, as S <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>our merits are the gifts of God,</hi> as the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>This is that which hath deſtroyed that impiety of <hi>Luther</hi> condemned by the ſame Councill, <hi>that we do not any way cooperate to our own ſalvation no more then things ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate:</hi> and it is this that in like manner deſtroyes the impiety of <hi>Molina's</hi> School, which will not acknowledge it to be the force of grace it ſelf that makes us coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with it in the work of our ſalvation; whereby he takes away that principle of faith eſtabliſhed by S. <hi>Paul, That it is
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:115411:253"/> God that worketh in us both the will and the deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is laſtly by this means, that all thoſe paſſages of Scripture which ſeem to be moſt contrary are reconciled. <hi>Turn ye unto God: O Lord turn us unto thee: Caſt away iniquity from you. It is God who taketh away iniquity from his people: bring forth workes worthy of repentance: The Lord hath wrought all our workes in us. Make ye a new heart and a new ſpirit; I will give you a new spirit, and will create in you a new heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The onely way then to reconcile thoſe apparent contradictions which attribute our good actions ſometimes to God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to our ſelves, is to acknowledg, that, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>our actions are ours, becauſe of the free will whereby they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and that they are alſo Gods becauſe of his grace which cauſes our free-will to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them.</hi> As alſo that, as he ſayes elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, God makes us to do what he pleaſes, by making us to will that which we might not have willed: <hi>à Deo factum est ut vellent, quod &amp; nolle potuiſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Father, is there a perfect harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny between your adverſaries and the new <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> ſince the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> hold, as they
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:115411:253"/> do, both the power to reſiſt grace, and the infallibility of the effect of grace, which they make profeſſion to maintain ſo reſolutely, according to this capitall maxime of their doctrine, which <hi>Alvarez,</hi> one of the moſt eminent among them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats ſo often in his book, and which he expreſſes <hi>diſp.</hi> 72. <hi>n.</hi> 4. in theſe termes. <hi>When the efficacious grace moves the free-will, it infallibly conſents, for the effect of grace is, to prevaile with it, that though it might not have conſented, yet, in effect, it does conſent.</hi> Whereof he gives this reaſon of his Maſter S. <hi>Thomas; That the will of God cannot but be accompliſhed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when he would have a man conſent to grace, he infallibly, nay neceſſarily does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet not through an abſolute neceſſity but a neceſſity of infallibility.</hi> Wherein yet grace derogates nothing from the power of reſiſting if a man will, ſince its onely effect is that a man will not reſiſt it, as your Father <hi>Petavius</hi> acknowledges in theſe termes, <hi>to.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 602. <hi>The grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt makes us infallibly to perſevere in piety, though not through neceſſity. For a man may not conſent thereto if he will, as the Councill ſaith; but the ſame grace obliges him that he will not but conſent thereto.</hi>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:115411:254"/> This, Father, hath been the conſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Proſper,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that followed them, of Councills, of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> of all the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> in general. It is alſo that of your Adverſaries, though you have not thought ſo much; and in a word, it is the very ſame that you your ſelves approve in theſe termes; <hi>The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of efficacious grace, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that a man hath the power to reſiſt it, is orthodoxe, grounded upon Councills, and maintained by the Thomists and Sorboniſts.</hi> Be ingenuous once, Father, had you known that your adverſaries really held this doctrine, would not the intereſt of your Society have hindered you from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it this publick approbation? And imagining they held the contrary thereto, hath not the ſame intereſt of your Society obliged you to authoriſe ſentiments ſuch as you thought contrary to theirs? and by that miſ-apprehenſion, where it was your deſign to undermine their principles, you have your ſelves abſolutely eſtabliſhed them. So that we now find, by a ſtrange kind of prodigy the defenders of efficacious grace juſtified by the defenders of <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> ſo admirable is the conduct of God, who makes all things contribute to the glory of his Truth.</p>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:115411:254"/>
               <p>Be it then known to all the world, that by your own acknowledgement, this truth of efficacious grace, requiſite in all actions of piety, a truth the Church is ſo tender of, and which is the price of the blood of her Saviour, is ſo apparently Catholick, that there is not any Catholick, even to the Jeſuits themſelves, that does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be orthodoxe. And it will be diſcovered at the ſame time, that they are not to be charged with the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of error, whom you have ſo prodigal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed. For as to thoſe ſecret errours you laid to their charge, without making any diſcovery thereof, it was as difficult for them to cleare themſelves of, as it was eaſie for you to load them with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of that nature; but now that you declare, that that errour, which hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged you to oppoſe them, is that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> which you thought they had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there is not any one but clearly ſees they are free from all errour: ſince they are ſo far contrary to that onely one you impoſe upon them, and that they proteſt by their diſcourſes, by their books, and by what ever they can produce to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their ſentiments, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that hereſie with all their ſoules,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:115411:255"/> and that in the ſame manner as the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> do, whom you make no difficulty to acknowledge to be Catholick, and who were never yet ſuſpected to be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>What wil you now have to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, Father? that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they do not follow <hi>Calvin's</hi> ſenſe, they are nevrtheleſſe hereticks, becauſe they will not acknowledge that the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is the ſame with that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin?</hi> Will you preſume to ſay that this is matter of hereſie? And is it not a pure queſtion of fact whence there cannot any be deriv'd? It were indeed a hereſie for a man to ſay that he hath not the power to reſiſt efficacious grace: but is it any to doubt whether <hi>Janſenius</hi> holds it? Is it a revealed Truth? Is it an article of faith, that ought to be believed upon pain of Damnation? Or is it not, in ſpight of your teeth, pure matter of fact? for which it were ridiculous to pretend there ſhould be any hereticks in the Church.</p>
               <p>Do not call them therefore any longer by that name, Father, but by ſome other that's proportionable to the nature of your difference. Say they are ignorant perſons and dunces, and that they miſtake <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> very much: theſe will be reproches
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:115411:255"/> ſuitable to your difference; but to call them hereticks, there is no colour in the world. And ſince it is the onely injury from which I would vindicate them, it will coſt me no great pains to ſhew that they underſtand <hi>Janſenius</hi> very well. And for his part, all I ſhall ſay of him, is, that in my judgement, Father, meaſuring him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according to your own rules, it wil be hard if he paſſe not for a Catholick: for theſe are the grounds you would have him examined by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To diſcover,</hi> ſay you, <hi>whether</hi> Janſenius <hi>be free from errour, we muſt know whether he defends efficacious grace after</hi> Calvins <hi>way, who denies that a man hath the power to reſiſt it; for in that caſe he were a here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: or after the way of the</hi> Thomiſts, <hi>who admit that he hath; for in that caſe he were a Catholik.</hi> See then, Father, whether he holds that a man hath the power to reſiſt or not, when he maintains in whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, and among others, <hi>to. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>That a man hath alwaies the power to reſiſt grace, according so the Councills,</hi> THAT THE FREE-WILL MAY AT ANY TIME ACT AND NOT ACT, <hi>will and not will, conſent and not conſent, do good and evil, and that a man hath ever in this life
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:115411:256"/> thoſe two Liberties, which they call of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie and contradiction.</hi> See alſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not clear from <hi>Calvins</hi> errour, ſuch as you repreſent it, as ſhewing throughout the whole 21. <hi>chap. That the Church had condemned that Heretick, for denying that efficacious grace works not upon the free-will in the manner it hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſo long in the Church, that is, ſo that it may be afterwards in the power of the free-will to conſent or not to conſent; whereas, according to Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, a man hath alwayes the power not to conſent if he will, and according to Saint</hi> Proſper, <hi>God ſo beſtows on his elect the will to perſevere, that he takes not away from them the power of willing the contrary.</hi> And laſtly, ſee whether he be not conſonant to the <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> when he declares, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>That whatever the</hi> Thomiſts <hi>have written to reconcile the efficacity of grace with the power of reſiſting it, is ſo conformable to his ſenſe, that there needs no more then to look into their books to learn his ſentiments thereof. Quod ipſi dixerunt dictum puta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus doth he ſpeak to all theſe heads; and I think this ground enough for me to imagine that he believes the power of his will to reſiſt grace; that he is contrary
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:115411:256"/> to <hi>Calvin,</hi> and conformable to the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> becauſe he ſaies it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he is Catholick according to you. But if you know any way to diſcover the ſenſe of an Author otherwiſe then by his expreſſions, and that without citing any one paſſage of his, you will nevertheleſs maintain, contrary to his words, that he denies this power of reſiſtance, and that he is for <hi>Calvin</hi> contrarie to the <hi>Thomiſts;</hi> never fear, Father, I ſhall charge you with hereſie for ſo doing, I ſhall onely ſay, that you underſtand not <hi>Janſenius</hi> very well, but we ſhall nevertheleſs be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>Whence comes it then, Father, that you betray ſo much paſſion in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings about this difference, and that you treat as your moſt cruel enemies, and as moſt dangerous hereticks, ſuch as you cannot charge with any errour, or any thing elſe but that they underſtand not <hi>Janſenius</hi> as you do? For what difference is there between you but about the ſenſe of the Author? You would have them condemn him, but they ask you what you mean by it. You ſay you mean <hi>Calvins</hi> errour, their anſwer is that they condemn it; ſo that if your quarrel be not with
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:115411:257"/> the ſyllables, but with the thing they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, you ought to be ſatisfied. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſay that they condemn the ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> 'tis becauſe they believe it to be that of Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi> And ſo that word is very equivocal between you; in your mouth it ſignifies <hi>Calvins</hi> ſenſe, in theirs, Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>'s: ſo that theſe different Ideas you have of the ſame terme being the occaſion of all your diviſions, were I moderator of your diſputes, I ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid both ſides to uſe the word <hi>Janſenius.</hi> And ſo expreſſing onely what you mean thereby, it would be found that you deſire onely the condemnation of the ſenſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> whereto they conſent; and that all they deſire is to vindicate the ſenſe of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> wherein you all agree.</p>
               <p>I tell you then, Father, that for my part I ſhall ſtill look on them as Catholicks, whether they condemn <hi>Janſenius</hi> in caſe they find any errours in him; or condemn him not, when they find nothing in him but what you declare to be Catholick; and ſhall ſpeak to them as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> did to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who was charg'd with maintaining eight propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Origen; Either condemn</hi> Origen,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:115411:257"/> ſaith that Saint, <hi>if you acknowledge that he hath held thoſe errours, or deny that ever he held them: Aut nega hoc dixiſſe eum qui arguitur, aut ſi locutus eſt talia, eum damna qui dixerit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, Father, the proceedings of thoſe who onely oppoſe mens errours and not their perſons; whereas you who have a greater quarrel at perſons then their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, think it nothing to condemn errours, if you do not withall condemn the perſons on whom you would faſten them.</p>
               <p>How violent is your proceeding, Father, but withal how unlikely to prove fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate! I told you ſo once before, and I tell it you again, Violence and truth can prevaile nothing one upon another. Your accuſations were never ſo outragious; nor was the innocency of your Adverſaries ever more manifeſt: never was efficacious grace aſſaulted with more artifice, and never have we ſeen it better fortified. You do all that lies in your power to make the world believe that your differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern matters <hi>of faith,</hi> and it was never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known that all your diſpute is onely about matter <hi>of fact.</hi> To be ſhort, you leave not a ſtone unmov'd to make
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:115411:258"/> men believe that this matter of fact is true, and people were never in ſo good an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to queſtion it. And the reaſon of it is clear. 'Tis, Father, becauſe you go not the ordinarie way to make a matter of fact credible, which is to ſatisfie the ſenſe, and to ſhew in a book the words alledged to be therein. But you take courſes that are at ſuch a diſtance from this ſimplicitie, that even the duller ſort of people are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it. Why did you not go the ſame way I did in my LETTERS, where I diſcover ſo many corrupt Maximes of your Authors, which is, faithfully to cite the places whence they are taken. The ſame courſe was taken by the Paſtors of <hi>Paris,</hi> and it never fails winning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into belief. For what would you have ſaid, and the world thought, when they reproched you, for inſtance, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your Father <hi>Amicus, That a Religious man may kill him that threatens to traduce him or his Community, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe prevent it;</hi> if they had not cited the place where it is in expreſs terms; if, how much ſoever you might preſs them to it, they ſhould ſtill refuſe to cite it, and, inſtead of that, had been at <hi>Rome</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Bull, commanding all to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:115411:258"/> it? Would it not be thought, that, without all queſtion, they had ſurpriſed the Pope, and that they had not taken that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie courſe, but for want of thoſe natural waies, which truths depending on matters of fact do ever furniſh thoſe with that maintain them? So that having onely alledged that Father <hi>Amicus</hi> teaches this doctrine in <hi>to.</hi> 5. <hi>disp.</hi> 36. <hi>num.</hi> 118. <hi>pag.</hi> 544. of the <hi>Douay</hi> Edition, all thoſe who were deſirous to ſee whether it were ſo, have found it, and all are ſatisfied. This now is an eaſie and ready way to reſolve queſtions of fact.</p>
               <p>Whence comes it then, Father, that you do not make uſe of it? you ſaid in your <hi>Cavilli, That the five Propoſitions are in</hi> Janſenius, <hi>word for word, all in expreſs termes, totidem verbis.</hi> You were told they were not What then was to be done, but either to cite the page, if you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally found them there, or to confeſs you were miſtaken? But you do neither, and waving that, and finding that all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Janſenius</hi> alledg'd by you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, onely to daze the world, are not the <hi>individual, and ſingular condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I am not ignorant, Father, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that Chriſtians owe the holy See, and your Adverſaries have given ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that they are reſolved ever to own it: but do not you imagine it ſhall argue the leaſt defect thereof to repreſent to the Pope, with all ſubmiſſion, as Children ought to their Father, and Members to their Head, that it is not impoſſible he might be ſurpriſ'd in that matter of fact; That he hath not cauſ'd it to be examin'd ſince his coming to the Chaire; and that his Predeceſſor <hi>Innocent</hi> X. had onely cauſ'd it to be examin'd whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were heretical, not whether they were <hi>Ianſenius</hi>'s: (which gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie of the H.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:115411:259"/> other able and godly perſons have read over the book very exactly, yet found them not there, but met with ſome that were contrarie thereto: That thoſe who had made thoſe falſe repreſentations to the Pope might very well be thought to abuſe the truſt he repoſed in them, it being their main concernment, as intereſſed perſons, to diſcredit that Author, who had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Molina</hi> above 50. errours: That what makes all this the more credible, is that they hold this Maxime one of the moſt authentick of all their Theologie, viz. <hi>that they may, without crime, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate thoſe by whom they think they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly moleſted;</hi> and conſequently, their teſtimony being ſuſpicious, and that of the others ſo conſiderable, there is ſome ground to intreat his Holineſs, with all poſſible humilitie, to order this matter of fact to be examin'd in the preſence of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of both ſides, ſo to determine it by a ſolemn and regular deciſion. <hi>Let able and competent judges be aſſembled,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> upon ſuch another occaſion, <hi>Ep.</hi> 75. <hi>before whom let every one be free; Let my writings be examined: Let them ſee whether there be any errours contrary to faith: Let both the Objections and the Anſwers be read,

               </p>
               <p>Think not, Father, to make thoſe be accounted refractory toward the holy See that ſhall take this courſe. The Popes are far from treating Chriſtians with that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny which ſome would exerciſe under their names. <hi>The Church,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, upon <hi>Job. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>which hath been brought up in the School of Humility, does not command with authority, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades by reaſon what ſhe would teach her children whom ſhe thinks enſnared into ſome errour: Recta quae erantibus dicit, non quaſi ex authoritate praecipit, ſed ex ratione per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadet.</hi> And they are ſo far from thinking it any way diſhonourable to retract a judgement wherein they had been ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they as it were triumph in the contrary, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Ep.</hi> 180. <hi>The Apostolick See,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath this for which it is much to be celebrated, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:115411:260"/> ſuggeſted to Popes; ſince that all Divines do unanimouſly hold they may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed; the tranſcendent quality they are of being, as to that, ſo far from ſecuring them, that, on the contrary, it many times makes them the more ſubject thereto, by reaſon of the infinite buſineſſe whereby they are diſtracted.

They acknowledge themſelves that Popes and the greateſt Kings are more ſubject to be over-reached then perſons whoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:115411:261"/> are of leſſe conſequence. We muſt take their words. And it is no hard matter to imagine by what meanes it comes to paſſe that they are ſo ſurpriſed: S. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes a diſcription of it, in a Letter he writ to <hi>Innocent</hi> II. in this manner. <hi>It is not a thing ſtrange and to be wondred at, that the spirit of man may deceive and be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. There are ſome Religious men come to you, with a spirit of lying and illuſion. They have spoken to you againſt a Biſhop whom they hate, though he be a man of an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life. Theſe perſons bite like Dogs, and would turn good into evil. In the mean time, holy Father, you are exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your Son. Why have you given his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries occaſion to rejoyce? Believe not every ſpirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God. I hope, that, when you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the truth, whatever hath been built upon a falſe report will vaniſh into aire. I earneſtly beſeech the ſpirit of truth to give you grace to ſeparate light from darkneſſe, and to reprove the evil, that you may encourage the good.</hi> You ſee then, Father, that the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree wherein Popes are, exempts them not from ſurpriſe, and that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make their ſurpriſes ſeem the more dangerous and of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:115411:261"/> That is repreſented by S. <hi>Bernard</hi> to Pope <hi>Eugenius, de conſid. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c. ult. There is yet another generall default, which I have not met with any of the great ones of the world that doth avoid. That is, holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, over-eaſineſſe of belief, the dame of ſo many diſorders. For thence do violent perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions proceed againſt the innocent, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced are unjust againſt the abſent, and thoſe that are inclined to choler, grow terrible for things of no conſideration, pro nihilo. This, holy Father, is an univerſall evil, from which if you are free, I ſhall affirme that you onely have that advantage over your brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This methinkes, Father, muſt needs in ſome meaſure convince you that Popes are ſubject to be ſurpriſed. But that you may take a full and perfect view of it, I ſhall onely put you in mind of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which you alledge in your book, of Popes and Emperours that have real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſurpriſed by Hereticks. For you ſay, that <hi>Apollinaris</hi> ſurpriſed Pope <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> as <hi>Celeſtius</hi> had done <hi>Zozimus.</hi> You ſay further that one named <hi>Athanaſius</hi> circumvented the Emperour <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and drew him in to perſecute the Catholicks. And laſtly, that <hi>Sergius</hi> obtained from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> that Decree, which was afterwards
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:115411:262"/> burnt in the ſixth Council, <hi>by his collogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſinuations with that Pope,</hi> as you ſay.</p>
               <p>It is therefore evident from your ſelf, Father, that thoſe who make ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their intereſt with Kings and Popes, do ſometimes craftily engage them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe who defend the true faith, while they think they perſecute hereſies. And thence it comes that the Popes who have nothing in ſo much horrour as theſe ſurpriſes, have of a Letter of <hi>Alexander</hi> III. made an eccleſiaſticall Law, inſerted into the Canonicall, to permit the ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the execution of their Bulls and Decrees, when it is thought they have been miſ-informed. <hi>If it happen ſometimes,</hi> ſayes the Pope to the Archbiſhop of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna, <hi>that we ſend to your Fraternity ſuch Decrees as you are not ſatisfied with, trouble not your ſelf at it. For you may either with reverence put them in execution, or give us an account why you think they ought not, and we ſhall take it well at your hands that you execute not any decree which might have been procured from us, either by ſurpriſe or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Thus do thoſe Popes proceed who endeavour nothing ſo much, as to cleare up the differences among Chriſtians, and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:115411:262"/> not to comply with their paſſions who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their diſtraction. They uſe no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but the ſpirit which guides all their proceedings is that of peace and truth. Whence it comes that ordinarily they put into their Letters this clauſe, which indeed is underſtood in all; <hi>Si Ita est: ſi preces veritate nitantur: if the thing be as we have been informed; if the matter of fact be true.</hi> Whence it is evident, that ſince the Popes give not force to their Bulls but ſo far as they are grounded upon truth in matter of fact, the Bulls alone do not prove the matter of fact to be true; but on the contrary, even according to the Canoniſts themſelves, tis the truth in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact that authenticates the Bulls. Whence then are we to learn the truth in matter of fact? From the eyes, Father, the legall judges thereof, as reaſon is of things naturall and intelligible, and faith of things ſupernaturall and revealed. For ſince you oblige me to this diſcourſe, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I muſt tell you, that according to the opinions of two of the greateſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> theſe three principles of our knowledge, have every one their ſeverall
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:115411:263"/> objects, and with in that extent their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. And whereas God thought fit to uſe the mediation of the ſences to give Faith entrance; <hi>Faith cometh by hearing:</hi> yet ſo far is faith from derogating from the certainty of the ſenſes, that, on the contrary, 'twere to deſtroy Faith, to bring the faithfull report of the ſenſes into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For which reaſon S. <hi>Thomas</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly obſerves, that God would needs have the ſenſible accidents to ſubſiſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, to the end the ſenſes, which judge onely of accidents, ſhould not be deceived: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſenſus à deceptione reddantur immunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conclude we hence then, that what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſoever be preſented to our exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, we muſt in the firſt place diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nature of it, to ſee which of the three principles it is referrible to. If it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to ſomething ſupernaturall, we are not to judge of it either by ſenſe or reaſon, but by the Scripture and the deciſions of the Church. If it concern a propoſition not revealed, and proportionable to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reaſon, ſhe ſhall be the proper judge thereof. And laſtly, if the diſpute be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matter of fact, we muſt ſubmit to our ſenſes, to whom it naturally belongs to take cognizance thereof.</p>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:115411:263"/>
               <p>This rule is ſo generall, that according to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> when the Scripture it ſelf preſents us with ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage whereof the litterall ſenſe is contrary to what the ſenſes and Reaſon judge of it with certainty, we muſt not endeavour to weaken the teſtimony of theſe to ſubmit them to that apparent ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but we muſt interpret the Scripture, and find out ſome other ſenſe thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable even with that ſenſible truth: becauſe the word of God being infallible even in matters of fact, and the report of the ſenſes and of reaſon acting within their limits, being alſo certain, theſe two truths muſt of neceſſity be reconciled; and as the Scripture may be interpreted ſeverall wayes, and the report of the ſenſes can be but one, ſo muſt we in ſuch caſes take that for the true interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is moſt conſonant to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full report of the ſenſes. <hi>We are,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Thomas</hi> 1. <hi>p. q.</hi> 68. <hi>a.</hi> 1. <hi>to obſerve two things according to Saint</hi> Auguſtine; <hi>one, that the Scripture hath ever ſome true ſenſe; the other, that whereas it may admit of diverſe, ſenſes, when a man meets with one that reaſon finds guilty of falſhood, he muſt not be ſo obſtinate as to affirme that to be the naturall ſenſe thereof,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:115411:264"/> but find out another not diſconſonant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he explaines by a paſſage out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it is written <hi>that God created two great Lights, the Sun and the Moon, and the Stars alſo;</hi> So that the Scripture ſeems to ſay that the Moon is greater then all the Stars. But in regard that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by unqueſtionable demonſtration that this is falſe, we ought not, ſaies this Saint, obſtinately to maintain the literal ſenſe, but find out another conformable to that truth in matter of fact, as to ſay, <hi>that the word</hi> Great light <hi>ſignifies onely the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the light of the Moon in respect of us, and not the greatneſs of her body conſidered in it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should we do otherwiſe, we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the veneration due to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nay, on the contrary, it were to expoſe it to the contempt of Infidels; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> as the ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>when they ſhould diſcover that we believe, out of the Scripture, ſuch things as they know to be perfectly falſe, they would laugh at our credulity in other things that are more myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as the reſurrection of the dead, and eternal life.</hi> And conſequently, ſaith Saint <hi>Thomas, we ſhould render our Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:115411:264"/> to them, and divert them from embracing it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly, Father, 'tis alſo a way to hinder <hi>Hereticks</hi> from embracing, it and to make the Popes Authority contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to refuſe to account thoſe Catholicks who would not believe that ſuch words are in a book where they are not to be found, becauſe a Pope had declar'd it by ſurprize. For it is onely the examination of a book that can diſcover that ſuch words are in it. Matters of fact are onely prov'd by the ſenſes. If what you maintain be true, ſhew it: if not, perſwade none to believe it; it were to no purpoſe. All the powers in the world cannot, by authority, perſwade men that a matter of fact is ſo, no more then they can change it; for there is nothing can make that which is, not to be.</p>
               <p>'Twas to no purpoſe, for inſtance, that the Religious men of <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> obtain'd of Pope Saint <hi>Leo</hi> the IX. a ſolemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree whereby he declar'd that the body of Saint <hi>Denys</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who according to the common opinion was the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> had been tranſlated out of <hi>France</hi> and brought into the Church of their Monaſtery. This hinders not but
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:115411:265"/> that the body of this Saint ever was and ſtill is in the famous Abbey that bears his name, where you would have found it a hard matter to get this Bull receiv'd, though it pretends that he had examin'd the buſineſs <hi>with all poſſible diligence, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiſſime; and that with the advice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Biſhops and Prelates; ſo that he ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charges all the French, districtè praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, to confeſs and acknowledge that they have not thoſe holy Reliques any longer.</hi> And yet the French who by their own eyes knew the matter of fact to be falſe, and who, having opened the ſhrine, found all thoſe reliques entire, as the Hiſtorians of that time teſtifie, believ'd then, as it hath ever been believ'd ſince, the contrary to what that Pope had enjoyned them to believe, as knowing that even <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> are ſubject to be ſurpriz'd.</p>
               <p>Nor was it to any more purpoſe that you obtain'd againſt <hi>Galilaeo</hi> that decree of <hi>Rome</hi> that condemn'd his opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of the Earth. There muſt be ſomething elſe to prove that it ſtands ſtill; and were it once evident by conſtant obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that it is the earth that moves, all men put together would not hinder it from moving, nay would be forc'd to move with
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115411:265"/> it. In like manner, you are not to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Letters of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> for the excommunication of Saint <hi>Virgili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> for affirming that there were <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes,</hi> have diſſolv'd that new world; nay though the Pope had declar'd that opinion to be a very dangerous errour, yet the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> gave more credit to <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> who came thence, then to the judgment of the Pope who never had been there; and conſequently you are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Church reap'd no ſmall benefit thereby, ſince it prov'd a means to communicate the Goſpel to ſo many people, who otherwiſe had periſhed in their infidelity.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, Father, of what nature matters of fact are, and by what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they are to be judg'd of; whence it is eaſie to conclude, as to the buſines we have in hand, that, if the five Propoſitions are not in <hi>Janſenius,</hi> it is impoſſible they ſhould have been extracted thence, and that the only way to judge aright of them, and to perſwade the world of the truth thereof, is to examine that book in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated conference; a thing you have been a long time preſſed to. Till then, there is no ground in the world you ſhould charge
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115411:266"/> your adverſaries with Obſtinacy; for they ſhall be as free from blame, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the matter of fact, and innocent as to both.</p>
               <p>Who then, Father, can avoid aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee on the one ſide, ſo clear a vindication, and on the other ſuch violent accuſations? Who would think that all the difference between you were about a matter of fact of no conſequence, which yet you would have believed without the leaſt demonſtration? And who durſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you ſhould raiſe ſuch a diſturbance in the Church for nothing, <hi>pro nihilo,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes? But it is a main piece of your policy to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all lies at ſtake in a buſineſs that amounts to nothing, and to perſwade thoſe who are in power that give you any credit, that the matter in diſpute is about the moſt pernicious errours of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and relating to principles wherein faith is moſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſo to engage them by that perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to employ their utmoſt zeal and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt thoſe you think your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as if the welfare of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depended thereon; whereas if they were but once convinc'd, that all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is about that inconſiderable matter
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:115411:266"/> of fact, it would never trouble their thoughts; nay on the contrary, it would be no ſmall regret to them, that they had been ſo far over-forward to comply with your particular paſſions, in a buſineſs wherein the Church hath not the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
               <p>For in fine, to take things at the worſt, were it true, that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Propoſitions, what inconvenience would enſue that ſome perſons were not ſatisfied he did, it being granted that they deteſt them, as they publickly do? Is it not ſufficient that they are condemn'd by al the world without any exception, even in that ſenſe wherein you have declar'd that you would have them condemn'd? Could they be more cenſur'd, though it ſhould be affirm'd that <hi>Janſenius</hi> had held them? To what end then is this acknowledgment ſo much preſſed, unleſs it be to diſcredit a Doctor and Biſhop, who died in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church? I cannot conceive this ſo great an advantage, as that it ſhould be purchaſed with ſo much diſturbance. What concernment hath the State, the Pope, the Biſhops, the Doctors, and the whole Church in this buſineſs? It hath not the leaſt reflection on them, Father,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:115411:267"/> and indeed there's none but your Society that would derive ſome ſatisfaction from the infamy of an Author that had a little offended you. And yet all is in tumult, becauſe you would have it believed that all is in danger. This is the ſecret engine that occaſions all thoſe great motions, which would ſoon ceaſe, were your differences but ones rightly ſtated. And therefore, ſince it would contribute very much to the quiet of the Church, that things were once well clear'd up, is was a matter of great conſequence to inſiſt upon it, to the end that your ſycophancy being diſcover'd, all the world may be convinced, that your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations are without any ground, your adverſaries without errour, and the Church without Hereſie.</p>
               <p>And this, Father, is the end I aim'd at, which I thought ſo conſiderable in regard of Religion, that I cannot eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how thoſe whom you have given ſo much occaſion to ſpeak, can ſtill be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Though they were not moved at the injuries you do them in particular, yet thoſe the Church endures ſhould methinks engage them to ſome reſentment thereof; beſides the queſtion I make whether Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks may expoſe their reputation to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:115411:267"/> eſpecially in matters of faith. And yet they give you leave to ſay what you pleaſe; inſomuch that were it not for the occaſion you have accidentally given me to ſay ſomething, it may be there had been no oppoſition made to thoſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſuggeſtions you ſo liberally ſcatter up and down. So that I am aſtoniſh'd at their patience, and that ſo much the more by reaſon I am confident it cannot proceed either from weakneſs or want of courage, as knowing they cannot be unfurniſh'd either with reaſons for their own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or zeal for the truth. And yet I find them ſo religiouſly ſilent, that I fear me they are guilty of ſome exceſs as to that point. For my part, Father, I thought it matter of duty to do what I have. Diſturb not the peace of the Church, and I ſhall be tender of yours. But while you make it your buſineſs to put all things into tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and diſtraction, the children of peace muſt needs be oblig'd to do all that lies in their power to have the peace kept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
